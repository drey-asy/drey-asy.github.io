		<description><![CDATA[I am seeing trailers for Cloud Atlas on TV now... Looks really good.  

Earlier this year, I attended a 48 Hour Film Project screening.  Each movie was only 5 or so minutes long, and you never knew what you were going to see next.  Sort of like reading a short story anthology.  

Some of the movies were pretty bad, but many were surprisingly good.  The audience had a blast, and I would recommend that you check out the Austin one next year (if you haven&#039;t already gone to one).]]></description>
