		<description><![CDATA[Ah, but what Drey did not reveal is that Google, in their infinite wisdom, dialed the phone for me.

So I called 1-800-GOOG-411, said &quot;Austin, Texas&quot; and then said &quot;Tiff&#039;s Treats,&quot; and the magical gnomes at my destination answered the phone.

MMmmm, hive mind and voice recognition.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, to my apartment complex. I&#039;m sure if someone were trying hard to look for me, it wouldn&#039;t matter if they had my address already or not. $15 buys you anyone&#039;s street address. Besides, what are they going to do, knock on every door of every building until they found me?]]></description>
