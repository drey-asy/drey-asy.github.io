		<description><![CDATA[IJL is marketed towards &quot;busy professionals&quot; which, so far, has meant mainstream upper middle class/lower high class business owners, VPs, etc.

I didn&#039;t have that great of an experience with the ABQ office, but the Austin office is very professional. One thing I learned is that they do not match at all based on physical preferences. This was odd because the ABQ office had me go into detail on what I was looking for physically.

So far, I&#039;ve had the most success just meeting people organically: at normal life functions, parties, through a friends, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reading your back posts.  I don&#039;t know if this was one or if I just missed it the first time.

My brother considered It&#039;s Just Lunch and eventually didn&#039;t go with it because of the expense.  Thus I&#039;m very curious about your evaluation of the service.

The trick is that he&#039;s more mainstream in his geekitude.  It might have actually worked for him.  He&#039;s a (serious) Linux-head and a video game player, but in that, &quot;these are my guy things&quot; sort of way, a way that segregates those parts of his life from others.  I don&#039;t think he&#039;d need or seek a mate with those kinds of quirky hobbies, and indeed his fiancee of 5 years and now his current girlfriend are entirely mainstream.

Myself, I seek in a mate a lot of what I seek in a friend.  (Yes, I&#039;m not planning on looking anytime soon, but it still applies.)  And that means both being creative sharing or at least appreciating quirky subculture hobbies.  I don&#039;t think It&#039;s Just Lunch is marketed toward people like that in general.]]></description>
