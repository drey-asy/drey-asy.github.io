		<description><![CDATA[Ah, but isn&#039;t the connotation of the word &quot;surprise&quot; generally good?

Well...I guess it could be a nasty surprise.  But I&#039;m forever hopeful about those sorts of things...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Surprisingly, the races exterminated by the Cylons were removed without malice and were chronicled and remembered by them. The Cylons kept detailed records of all the races they destroyed, including their artifacts.  Once an enemy was eliminated, the Cylons adapted all that was left behind.

When the mechanical Cylons discovered humans, they copied their bodies and attempted to copy their ingenuity. In time, they came to understand humans well, and learned what weaknesses to exploit. They became smarter than humans but were never able to understand the unpredictable and sometimes irrational nature of the human mind.

This may have helped the Imperious Leader decide that humans had to be exterminated&quot;

How can you plan like a Cylon?
Unlike Monica, I don&#039;t want you to &quot;leave&quot; the universe in any way at all.
