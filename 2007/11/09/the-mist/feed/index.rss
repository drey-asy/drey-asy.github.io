		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments... this was a movie I was interested in checking out.  Now I think I&#039;ll probably wait to rent it on DVD.  

Did you ever play the text adventure?  I downloaded it from the Underdogs site and tried it out.  I got frustrated with it pretty quickly!
