		<description><![CDATA[While I am optimistic about House of Whack, it is still too early to call it an unmitigated success! :)

Yes, the drums in Rock Band are really challenging. If you play on Easy, you are essentially playing a fraction of the beats. On normal, you are playing an easier version of what the real drummer would play. On Hard, you are playing pretty much exactly what the drummer in the song plays. On extreme, you are playing what drum gods play.

If you see Rock Band somewhere, grab it. It has been selling out. I can&#039;t afford my own copy yet, but soon...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Drey!

I&#039;m so happy your game is an unmitigated success! I am a daily reader now (and by daily I mean I&#039;ve read for the one day I&#039;ve known of your blog) so it will be nice to hear about what&#039;s going on in your life! You actually play drums in this game???? (*runs to Best Buy to buy game so that he can, in some way or another, pretend he is Dave Grohl*)!
