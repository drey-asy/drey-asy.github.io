		<description><![CDATA[Woot.  Got your comment.

Yeah, I went out to the page and read around, and I got a better idea of what it&#039;s about.  In LJ-speak, it&#039;s like reading other people&#039;s friend lists: the amalgam feed of all the LJs THEY read.  That&#039;s kind of cool.  I do browse LJ profiles of friends and blog link lists for interesting-sounding communities sometimes.  But I&#039;m a highly social blogger, rather than a political blogger or a weirdness blogger or whatnot.  The most interesting communities I actually read are about crochet, which I&#039;m quite sure would put you to sleep.]]></description>
