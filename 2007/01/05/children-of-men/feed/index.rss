		<description><![CDATA[This film is my #1 so far -- it far outstripped &quot;Pan&#039;s Labyrinth&quot;, which I expected to be the winner hands down.  The whole ending sequence in the refugee camp... that was harrowing and moving all at once.  And yet the most horrific thing is that that refugee camp is not an unfamiliar experience for a significant chunk of the world *right now*.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really excited about this movie, and I&#039;ve only learned of its existence a week or so ago.  Clive Owen is a great actor -- I&#039;ve been a fan of his ever since seeing (and playing as him) in Privateer 2.  

I&#039;ll definitely have to check this movie out!]]></description>
