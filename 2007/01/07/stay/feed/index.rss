		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never heard of Stay at all.  I&#039;ll have to check it out.  Is it just me, or is there a glut of interesting things out in the theater at the moment?  It&#039;s a relief after the drought of last year....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The script got picked up for quite the wad of cash, but the movie didn&#039;t do so well.  Not sure if this was a function of advertising or the time of year it came out.  I read half of the script, but I still haven&#039;t seen the movie.  Children of Man has had a thumbs up from everyone I know who&#039;s seen it.  Going to have to save my pennies to go see it myself:)]]></description>
