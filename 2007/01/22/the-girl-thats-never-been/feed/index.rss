		<description><![CDATA[I heard that song many years ago and thought &quot;OMG, I feel exactly the same way, &#039;outside of the world, looking in&#039;, and I didn&#039;t think there were others with that feeling!&quot;... and then in September, 2007, I was watching ReGenesis and heard a word I could start a search on, which lead to months of reading (mostly Tony Attwood) and consulting with my shrink. Now I have a diagnosis and my life has changed profoundly. I mean, I finally have a friend and my mother doesn&#039;t hate me anymore. Oh, I begin to sound like a commercial...eek! Anyway, if you feel alien, there might be a reason for that, and knowing the reason is part of the solution.
Peace,
Rod]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll definitely try to listen to the song!  Sounds like a good one, just on that level.

And although I know this is easier said than done, you should relax in your faith...  You are not given visions or longings if they are not out there.  They were given to you for a purpose.  And your steadfast belief and quiet certainty will help bring everything into alignment.

I have problems remembering that some days because I get all &quot;fraught&quot; and neurotic.  When I can get steady, I realize the future is right before me, and it&#039;s all going to work out.  

Life is strange, to be sure...]]></description>
