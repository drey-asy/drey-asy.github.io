		<description><![CDATA[Hello to you.
I know we hardly know eachother and all the other whatnots, but I am really proud of you for handeling such a difficult situation in such a good way. It truely takes a very strong person to overcome personal conflict such as this, and I look up to people like yourself who can have such a confusing disorder and still be able to make a beautiful looking game and even more so be able to be open about their feelings.

Being afraid that people won&#039;t accept you for who you are is always a biggy. But if they don&#039;t accept you then they are not worthy to have you around. From what I read on your blog and from the few times we have communicated, you are a wonderful person with tons of talent and you deserve to be loves and appriciated no matter what.

Anyways *hugs* I hope you continue down this path of positive thinking :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good for you for coming out into the open with this!  I know it can&#039;t be easy, but I think that you will find that all your friends will remain your friends and not think of you very differently -- at least I won&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the details.  I know that this is something very personal to talk about, and I deeply admire you for coming forth with information where I can read it.  I would dearly love to know more inasmuch as you care to share it: it helps me know you better, and it allows me to vicariously glimpse places my mind can never go on its own.]]></description>
