		<description><![CDATA[Drey, this is Dave. It occurred to me, as I read your comment, that so much inspiration is just outside your window, I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re missing it, but it&#039;s staggering how easy it is to miss the beauty. The scene outside is evocative, and hints at the smell of fresh, warm air, plants growing, birds singing... you can smell that life just outside the window. I&#039;m not sure about the weather you live with where you are, but here we&#039;re just getting the first hints of spring as the snow melts away, and the first tenative sprouts poke their way through the earth. Sometimes that&#039;s enough to help me appreciate things as they are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;ve started to realize that there&#039;s not going to be a magical qualitative shift at some point in my life.  You know, you just get older, and  you know more, and you do whatever it is that you do... and is that good enough?  What else can you do?I wish I could say I was close to seeing that perspective on myself that you describe.]]></description>
