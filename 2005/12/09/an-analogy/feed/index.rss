		<description><![CDATA[might I hesitate a thought?  That perhaps loving a unicorn is never wrong...that love in it&#039;s truest form is never wrong.  That you can never really &quot;get rid&quot; of love if it is true, but only change it through transmutation (something of a alchemist in us).  But perhaps where the trouble lies is in expecting that a unicorn might change to keep your love, or assuming that they can.  Or of wanting to keep a unicorn.  But perhaps I&#039;m the wrong girl to ask, as when I watch Legend, I empathize most with the dark Lily who sits beside big D... but that&#039;s just the side of me that hates unicorns because she once wanted to touch one.I also read a good book many years ago called The Unicorn Creed, and it had a lovely discussion of the ugly and foolish sides of some unicorns... maybe you should read that one...]]></description>
