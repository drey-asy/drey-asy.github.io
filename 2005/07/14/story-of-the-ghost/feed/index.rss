		<description><![CDATA[no, but I think I recognize the guy!  So when you said you were sick of fake people, you really weren&#039;t kidding.  Shit.  I have to say, though, that I would have asked you out had you not had a girlfriend when we first met.  So I don&#039;t think you can say that all women would only be interested in you for one thing or other.  I kinda think the package is a pretty good one.  Don&#039;t let the fuckedupedness of this episode keep you from keeping in touch with your &quot;real&quot; friends.  Love and hugs, Monica]]></description>
