I won&#039;t be watching either, since everyone feels the need to have a religious epiphony before the show and thank God, even if they are still stoned when they say it. Besides, I&#039;m sure I will catch the replays of all the clips for weeks after. Sorry to be such a killjoy about this, but it is how I feel. The contractions and the &quot;pregnant crazies&quot; are not affecting my judgement at all.]]></description>
