		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think that sending USA a box of trash will open their hearts to any sort of dialogue. Until The 4400, I had forgotten there was a USA network and, now that it is canceled, it will go back to being forgotten. I guess they are cool with that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I maybe spinning my wheels, but if anyone is listening...
i have been all over the web and I can find nothing most resent about this obvious slap in the fACE, from the USA execs. the sad part of all of this is that those of us that are extremely disturbed by this abrupt cancellation will continue to fan the flames of the networks. So with no avail we will shout out with disgust at the indignity. But the networks will continue to see us as mindless drones that eat the shit they are shoveling in our troths. if the networks want to take away our steak and give us garbage. I say lets give them a dose of their own medicine. I campaign to you that we petition for people to sent a box with trash to the network, because sunflowers seed...come on, really? That&#039;s not going to get anyone&#039;s attention. There is no surprise, it&#039;s all been done before.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thats 4 sure, really like to know how to get thru to sci fi. That the  4400 and the DeadZone are shows that should keep going . But its all about the anti Christ taking over the air waves anything that half resembles anything powerful and life changing gets booted for candy floss and dixie chicks drinking out of sex in the city cups filled with rubbing alcohol. What the masses resembles somewhere between mediocrity and not believeing a devil exists , little lone knowing there is a God out there.]]></description>
