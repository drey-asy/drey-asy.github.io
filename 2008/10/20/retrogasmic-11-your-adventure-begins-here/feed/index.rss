		<description><![CDATA[HPunster: Yeah, the cover for Warlock of Firetop Mountain was the newer reprint. The originals were similar in appearance to the CYOA books: white cover, red lettering, and a large painted illustration. There were tons of the Fighting Fantasy books, so you might indeed have had a huge collection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally LOVED those Fighting Fantasy Books. I&#039;ve never heard of Sorcery! books, and I think by the time I saw the Lone Wolf books I was either finished with the genre, or concentrating on the FF books. I feel like there was another large series, that I had all the books for. Maybe it was FF, but the cover you showed must be a reprint. Did FF go over 40 books? Because I had a metric buttload of CYOA-type books. Now I&#039;m gonna rack my brains until I think of it. Maybe I gave them to my nephew...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article!  I look forward to your next one.  

I remember long ago reading a paper you worked on in school on interactive fiction.  You definitely have a lot of interesting thoughts on the topic.  

I have never heard of Maze before... but after hearing your brief praise (and checking it out on Amazon) I purchased a copy.]]></description>
