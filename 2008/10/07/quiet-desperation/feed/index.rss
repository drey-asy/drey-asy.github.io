		<description><![CDATA[And here are the lyrics

Revelation
words by Mac Powell / music by Third Day

My life has led me down the road thatâ€™s so uncertain
Now I am left alone and I am broken
Trying to find my way
Trying to find the faith thatâ€™s gone

This time I know that you are holding all the answers
Iâ€™m tired of losing hope and taking chances
On roads that never seem
To be the ones that bring me home

Give me a revelation
Show me what to do
â€˜Cause Iâ€™ve been trying to find my way
I havenâ€™t got a clue
Tell me should I stay here
Or do I need to move
Give me a revelation
Iâ€™ve got nothing without you
Iâ€™ve got nothing without you

My life has led me down this path thatâ€™s ever winding
Through every twist and turn, Iâ€™m always finding
That I am lost again
Tell me when this road will ever end

I donâ€™t know where I can turn
Tell me, when will I learn
Wonâ€™t you show me where I need to go
Let me follow your lead
I know that itâ€™s the only way that I can get back home
