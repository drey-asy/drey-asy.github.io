		<description><![CDATA[I always loved that song!  Thanks, Dave:)

As for the making of magic and the living in the real world, I often think that it&#039;s the ability to balance both that is important.  I can&#039;t stay away from the real world too long, but I also can&#039;t escape the fact that the intuitions and dreams and creating we do in the magic places bleed over into the real.  Life is just pretty strange that way.

But there is also a lot of wonderful in the ordinary world.  And though I&#039;m not math inclined, I often think figuring out how to live is something like balancing an equation.

Maybe I should have studied harder...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For some reason the recent shift in the tides of your person remind me of this Duran Duran song.....

  Came in from a rainy thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly.
I turned on the lights, the tv and the radio
Still I cant escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all? 
Crazy, somed say,
Where is the life that I recognize? 
Gone away...

But I wont cry for yesterday, theres an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world...
I will learn to survive.

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
Pride will tear us both apart
Well now prides gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
Left me in the vacuum of my heart.
What is happening to me? 
Crazy, somed say,
Where is my friend when I need you most? 
Gone away...

(chorus)

-

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Here today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(just blown away...)

And I dont... (chorus)

Every world, is my world... (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world ... (I will learn to survive)

Any world, is my world...
Every world is my world...]]></description>
