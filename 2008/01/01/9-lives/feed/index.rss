		<description><![CDATA[Sounds interesting... I just started a great series about a group of misfit Buddhist students who decide to start a business seeking revenge for corpses they find: &quot;Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service.&quot;  

Have you read Osuma Tezuka&#039;s &quot;Buddha&quot; or &quot;Phoenix&quot; series?  They are some of my other favorite non-shojo stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I do enjoy manga, I don&#039;t actively seek it out. That being said, I&#039;m currently reading Samurai Crusader written by Hiroi Oji and illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami (Crying Freeman, Sanctuary). It is a wonderful romp around the world and features Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, a cat burglar, robots, ninjas and the titular samurai.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I&#039;ve read a lot of manga - all different types.  I tend to stick to the shojo stuff, though, because I&#039;m a sucker for romance.  That one reason I love Bollywood so much, too!

Do you need recommendations?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know about &quot;pertinent facts,&quot; but the take home message was that you know a ton more about Bollywood films than I could ever hope to!

I&#039;m intrigued that you read manga (or at least you&#039;ve read one manga).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t mind at all, Smarty. My blog is there to be read.

I guess by &quot;women&#039;s issues,&quot; I mean the complex network of needs, desires and circumstances they face in relationships as well as the many roles they are called on to play in life. My definition also includes the physicality of being a woman and what sometimes goes along with that (pregnancy, breast cancer, birth control, etc.). I also include their perception and treatment by men.]]></description>
