		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE Torchwood!!  I think Captain Jack did some better acting when he was on Dr. Who, but I love the show anyway.  I&#039;m so happy to know that Season 2 is out!  Now I must go find it...

Veronica Mars is great, too  --  John hooked me on it.  The witty repartee is just amazing.]]></description>
