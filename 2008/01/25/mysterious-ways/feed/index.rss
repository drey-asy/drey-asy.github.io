		<description><![CDATA[Just keep in mind that there are women out there who are looking at the men with women on their arm wondering the same thing.  And just cause some are currently on an arm, doesn&#039;t mean they will stay there.

It&#039;s great that you went out!  Have some fun, listen to good music... increases the odds that you&#039;ll bump into someone if you&#039;re out and about.

Oh, and I meant to tell you, congrats on finding your venue for Something Real:)]]></description>
