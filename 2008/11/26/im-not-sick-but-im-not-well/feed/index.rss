		<description><![CDATA[This time of year is rough for people. I have a couple of family members who tend to go on big emotional benders every year, like clockwork, between Thanksgiving and Xmas.  It&#039;s very hard to be around them, knowing that anything (or nothing) could set them off and make them decide that I&#039;m Satan, or whatever.

good for you for working on it. Let me know if you want to hang out sometime. A bunch of us are going to the 37 1/2 st. Xmas lites on the 17th, and there&#039;s another crew going to the Zilker lites on the 21st.

*hugs* &#038; love.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The most positive thing about the month of December is that on the 21st, you have the shortest day of the entire year. It marks the darkest, longest night. But once the sun rises on the 22nd, each day will continue to shine longer and longer. I view the winter darkness as a period of true hibernation. Sometimes it helps me to mentally mark the Winter Solstice as a chance to awaken from the hibernation and welcome the light.

I am glad to hear you are making progress this year and keeping your head up. 

Cheers,
Lanes]]></description>
