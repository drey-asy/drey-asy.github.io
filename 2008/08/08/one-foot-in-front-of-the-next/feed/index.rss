		<description><![CDATA[fine. i admit it. i drive like a soccer mom. i am a soccer mom. i have a mini-van. and women get better insurance rates because they are better drivers. but this is not true of every woman across the board at every time in her life. there&#039;s a female nascar driver to prove my point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[and it&#039;s always been my impression that even ugly chicks only need get a man drunk or feed him. that&#039;s why men pay for (so i hear). not cuz men need it more, but because men can&#039;t get it as easily. just my theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i didn&#039;t mean to imply that women NEED the power to get laid. (they usually just have that power programmed in from birth) but some women like power for the sheer power of it. ya know, the need for speed. the open road. all that. and just &#039;cuz it usually makes the guys wish they were driving ;) but you&#039;re not that shallow, i get that. it was really just my attempt to promote my feminazisms, because i don&#039;t like the stereotypes of women drivers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[e. tells me that cars matter when men are driving them, because they are part of the male&#039;s mating display. But when women are driving them, nobody cares what kind of car it is because women don&#039;t need power or status to get laid. 

I think that&#039;s cynical and shallow...what kind of person chooses a mate based on toys? But I think I am not the real person in this exchange, that I am not really a human at all, because things that matter to real human women just don&#039;t work for me at all. All these games. bleh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do they really  have frozen chocolate covered bananas at TJs?  I love those bastards, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen them there.  Perhaps, though, I haven&#039;t been looking... so therefore I haven&#039;t seen them.

I believe in the one, but I also know we are pretty piss-poor at figuring it out beforehand.  I&#039;d say it&#039;s more like staying open to the entire world so that the one doesn&#039;t get shut out accidentally because we don&#039;t see them correctly.  

It reminds me of this part of Ozma of Oz, where the Nome King turns people into ornaments, and Dorothy has to try and guess who&#039;s-who in order to save them.  Except that you don&#039;t have a chicken named Belina to tell you what the secret to the game is...

Anyway, the pics from your trip are great, and it was very good to see you...]]></description>
