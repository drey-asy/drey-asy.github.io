		<description><![CDATA[Me? I always feel cold when I see or hear about my exes and their new lives. The man I lost my virginity to sent me a picture of his wife and 13 year old son...13 years and a few months after we&#039;d broken up (you do the math!) and I just felt the swish of a bullet barely missing me.  There but for the grace of goddess...

Something, someday will break and ruin me, but it won&#039;t be THAT one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sorry. but seriously, all your &quot;keys&quot; and &quot;triggers&quot; and your endless quest of the vulnerable heart all adds up to that magical mix you call drey.
