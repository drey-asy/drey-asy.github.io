		<description><![CDATA[This is really not about not wanting to say the expected &quot;fine.&quot; This is about how I have really lost track of my sense of self and I have no idea how to answer these questions.

When I pause to take stock of how I am, I don&#039;t know how to package the information I get from such introspection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the &quot;How are you?&quot; frustration.  I&#039;m like Monica.  I try to come up with an honest answer that doesn&#039;t beg any more inquiry.  Often, it&#039;s &quot;Tired,&quot; or &quot;I can&#039;t wait to get home,&quot; or somesuch.  But often it&#039;s just, &quot;Fine.&quot;  And often it&#039;s true.  I&#039;m doing adequately and up to my own satisfaction.

I really don&#039;t get people who say, &quot;How are you?&quot; when they&#039;re *passing you in the hall*.  There isn&#039;t even time for an answer.  I usually push for &quot;Hey there!&quot; or if I have more syllables: &quot;Nice to see you!&quot; if it&#039;s true, or &quot;Hope you&#039;re doing well!&quot;  Which is true for almost anyone, even if I don&#039;t actually like them.  And it isn&#039;t a question-answer, for which there is no time in a hall-passing situation.

I do ask my friends &quot;How are you&quot; and mean it.  I want real answers.  I don&#039;t apologize for it.  If I haven&#039;t seen someone for a while, it&#039;s a general-purpose question for any updates on their life or mental state since we talked last.

But I also recognize that we need SOME commitment-free polite things to say to people we don&#039;t know well.  &quot;How are you?&quot; is loaded, but it&#039;s what we have.  What would you suggest?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always answer that question with the longest answer possible. Once they start to get uncomfortable I realize they will never ask again. If they don&#039;t get even a little put off, I know they are someone I may need to avoid in the future. The exception to this rule is my mom. She has years of training at having an even longer response to anything I come up with. I finally give up and tell her I have to go get the kid to quit playing in traffic, and she agrees.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually try to mostly answer honestly.  I think my deep psychology appreciates the candor.  But what I find is helpful is to find ways which are honest, but which other people find amusing...

For instance, I occasionally say &quot;I&#039;ve had better...&quot;  or &quot;simply wretched&quot; and it seems to work for me...

On the flip side, any more I try to make myself as happy as possible so that if I&#039;m ask, I can honestly say I&#039;m pretty darn fabulous:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried that before, but I never had much luck with &quot;I don&#039;t know&quot; as a response.  Some people got angry, thinking I was being a wiseguy.  Most wanted to ask me more about my answer, which was the last thing I wanted to do.  Now I just go for the neutral &quot;Okay&quot; for a response.

How much do you want to bet the first thing I ask you next time we meet on IM is &quot;How are you?&quot;  I apologize in advance... Society has conditioned me well.

My most hated question/discussion involves the weather.  Can we find a more common denominator?]]></description>
