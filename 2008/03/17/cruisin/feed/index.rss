		<description><![CDATA[oh, oh, pictures!!!!

It sounds like you and I are travelling the same paths... my car got booted this week, and I had to pay to get it out, pay for parking tickets, and finally register it in CA.  Wayyyyy expensive.  I went and test drove two cars and also found out Sallie Mae (the thugs) were dinging my credit pretty badly with my late student loan payments!  So I got my old car all legal and will be trying to fix my credit so I can buy a new car later this year or early next year.  My Subaru is a 1990 and I have 260,000 miles on it, so it&#039;s definitely time...]]></description>
