		<description><![CDATA[People have stupider reasons for rejecting people:)

I once got dumped because I had to reschedule a date and that was just too &quot;unavailable.&quot;  Figure I dodged a bullet on that one actually, though I was miffed at the time.

Ever try getting in a deeply meditative state and asking it when she&#039;s coming along?  Sometimes the subconscious knows these things and will tell you, so then you can relax and keep the channels from getting pinched down with the stress of worry about it.

And as far as saving goes, just one of the many catnips for chicks.  You&#039;re probably going to just have to deal with that response:)  If you got a motorcycle, you&#039;d be deadly;)]]></description>
