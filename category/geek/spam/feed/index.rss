<p>There&#8217;s a weird urgency to it.  I feel like I&#8217;ve been given an important message, yet I don&#8217;t know what it means.  If I were paranoid, I might be a little concerned that the message came from an &#8220;Abdullah Xu.&#8221;  A Google search yields only <a href="http://www.vietpage.com/archive_news/politics/2002/Dec/24/0110.html">a single web page</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us begin,&#8221; the court president, a bald-headed and pudgy fleet admiral, said with fitting solemnity. &#8220;Let the trial open, let justice be done with utmost dispatch, and the prisoner found guilty and shot.&#8221;</p>
