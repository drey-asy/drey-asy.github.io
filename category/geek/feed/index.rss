				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This will be my last weekly post for the One a Day project. While I veered off course during the last few months, I think the important thing is that I followed through to the end. Finishing something after making a commitment is important to me. I haven&#8217;t completed the Dune game yet. In the coming year I need to figure out how to partition off time for creative projects in my post-single life. I think I will actually make new year&#8217;s resolutions for 2012. I want to lose some weight, figure out some other life stuff, and re-prioritize.</p>
<p>This was a great year for me. I want 2012 to be a year where I shape and focus the potential energy from 2011.</p>
<p>Bye for now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love my birthday. For me, it has lost that quality of a milestone that comes around to prompt reflection on the past year. Those milestones are happening throughout the year. My birthday is MY day. I get to do whatever I want, no matter how ridiculous. Usually this involves a party. This time around I had some folks over early in the afternoon to play the board game Talisman with almost all of the expansions. Later on, more people arrived to play Rock Band and enjoy beverages. My house was partitioned into the Rock Band Room, the Board Game Room, the Chill Out Room, and the Smoker&#8217;s Back Porch. While I did enjoy myself a great deal, I wish I could have had more time to hang out in each area.</p>
<p>Close to 30 people showed up, and that isn&#8217;t even all of my Austin friends. For me there is no fame, no heaven, no children, no inheritance, no stock options. There&#8217;s just my friends. They are my only reward in this life. Having a house full of them for just a few hours is the only metric I need to assess how I did this past year.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some of the games I played at BGG this year.</p>
<p><strong>Last Will</strong> &#8211; Your eccentric uncle has died, leaving you with a fortune. Thing is, the will stipulates you must spend your inheritance before the rest of the family in order to get the <em>real</em> inheritance. You can accomplish this by making poor real estate decisions, hiring expensive servants, going on expensive cruises and generally surrounding yourself with freeloaders. I liked this game enough to play it three times at the con. There&#8217;s lots of strategies to try once you get past the daunting list of special abilities the cards grant you.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Bowl: Team Manager</strong> &#8211; I had initially blown this off as Fantasy Flight saying &#8220;Blood Bowl would be too expensive to re-issue, so here&#8217;s a card game knock off instead.&#8221; Thankfully, I was wrong. This is a fun game that distills an entire season of Blood Bowl into just the best parts.</p>
<p><strong>Eminent Domain</strong> &#8211; Sleek, sci-fi deck building game with Puerto Rico-style role selection. Only got to play it once, but eager for another go.</p>
<p><strong>Auf Achse</strong> &#8211; An older Wolfgang Kramer game about trucking. Think Ticket to Ride but with money and cargo. Only some of the cards had English translations, so I employed the magic of Google Goggles to do on the fly translations.</p>
<p><strong>Panic Station</strong> &#8211; I really need to give this game another shot as I seem to be the only one who didn&#8217;t like it. The game aims to recreate the events of John Carpenter&#8217;s &#8220;The Thing.&#8221; Each player controls a human and an android who are searching through an abandoned science station in search of an alien hive. One of the players is secretly infected with an alien parasite, seeking to infect the other players. I found the game clunky and full of odd design choices.</p>
<p><strong>El Caballero</strong> &#8211; The love child of Carcassonne and El Grande, two of my favorite Euros. Supposedly Rio Grande is putting this game back in print.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Temple</strong> &#8211; Citadels Lite in the jungle. Fun, light game for people who have never played Citadels.</p>
<p><strong>Kingdom Builder</strong> &#8211; Being the designer of Dominion probably gives you carte blanche to make any kind of game you want. This includes very light, Through the Desert-esque games. Pretty but not very fun. Good intro game, though.</p>
<p>I played a lot of other games, mostly short filler games, but these were the ones that stuck in my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not touched my custom Dune board game project in many months. Mostly this is due to my weekends being taken up by Scare for a Cure and the overwhelming success of the Find a Girlfriend project.</p>
<p>This month, Fantasy Flight is releasing Rex: Final Days of an Empire, which is a re-themed version of Dune set in the Twilight Imperium universe. My plan is to play it (maybe at BoardGameGeek.con) and see if Fantasy Flight has any ideas worth stealing. They have an impressive track record for taking old classics and making them better.</p>
<p>Regardless of any game mechanic changes, I ought to return to making art for the game at some point. Anyhow, that&#8217;s all for now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Storage space is a currency of potential for me. Whenever I move into a new place I look at the drawers and cabinets, thinking &#8220;What could I fill these with?&#8221; The more compartmentalized a storage array is, the more appealing it is to me. Large storage capacities with inversely sized cosmetic footprints are also coveted. Deep cabinets set into a wall, for example. The workstation I sit at retracts into a closet so I can close the doors and forget it is even there. Delicious!</p>
<p>Digital storage holds a similar appeal. My two terabyte external drive is a tiny black library of universes. Worlds drift inside it. Years are spooled about its cores. Will it ever be full? Time will tell. With the recent popularity of cloud storage I find myself with gigabytes of potential floating out there. Somewhere in the heavens orbits the crystalline webwork which contains my data. Or so I envision it. I have vaults at Google, A2 Hosting, Amazon, DropBox, Apple, and Box.net. I feel the need to store particular data at particular places. My music is scattered between several locations. My documents as well. Some of these services are backup solutions. Some file sharing. I have a whole DropBox folder dedicated to board game rules! It is time to analyze each service and decide what goes where.</p>
<p>Beyond that, what *could* I be doing with all this space? What clever uses might there be? </p>
<p>Thoughts? </p>
