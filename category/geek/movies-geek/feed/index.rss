				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As has become the tradition, I will be posting my list of films I saw at Fantastic Fest, roughly in order of most enjoyable to least enjoyable. </p>
<p>Melancholia &#8211; Lars Von Trier&#8217;s ode to depression. Absolutely gorgeous, populated with real characters. Left me haunted.</p>
<p>The Corridor &#8211; I think this movie struck a peculiar chord with me, so I can&#8217;t really look at it objectively. I love movies where extraordinary realities invade normal ones and there is no real explanation. But the story isn&#8217;t *about* the extraordinary reality.</p>
<p>Headhunters &#8211; The show Leverage wishes it could be as clever as this movie. Plus it has Jaime Lannister.</p>
<p>We Need to Talk About Kevin &#8211; Oscar-worthy performance by Tilda Swinton. Difficult subject matter perfectly rendered.</p>
<p>Clown &#8211; Hysterically funny Hangover-style comedy based on a TV show which I must now track down.</p>
<p>Comic-Con Episode Four: A Fan&#8217;s Hope &#8211; Morgan Spurlock&#8217;s wonderful documentary on Comic-Con. Joyful and inspiring. It restored my love of geekdom.</p>
<p>The Yellow Sea &#8211; Up there with Old Boy as far as crazy Korean action/crime dramas.</p>
<p>You Said What? &#8211; Inspired by Miike&#8217;s &#8220;Audition&#8221;, a bunch of guys make a movie so their friend can get the girl. Charming and fun.</p>
<p>Extraterrestrial &#8211; Once again, Nacho subverts audience expectations and turns an alien invasion film into a romantic comedy.</p>
<p>El Narco &#8211; Beautifully shot and plotted. The Mexican Godfather.</p>
<p>Manborg &#8211; Homage to awesome/terrible 80s films. A labor of love shot on green screen over several years. Very funny.</p>
<p>Haunters &#8211; Reminded me of Unbreakable.</p>
<p>Carre Blanc &#8211; Darkly humorous dystopian tale of corporate life.</p>
<p>Borderline &#8211; The French movie version of the show &#8220;Weeds&#8221;.</p>
<p>Revenge: A Love Story &#8211; Liked the twists and turns in this one. Plays with audience expectations.</p>
<p>Elite Squad 2 &#8211; Kind of ordinary cop drama.</p>
<p>Penumbra &#8211; Did not live up to the hype. Great set up that really doesn&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>The Day &#8211; Totally ordinary post-apocalyptic survivor tale.</p>
<p>Angels &#038; Airwaves Presents &#8220;Love&#8221; &#8211; Had a few neat visuals, but it was kind of bland.</p>
<p>Livid &#8211; A gorgeous mess.</p>
<p>Beyond the Black Rainbow &#8211; Tedious.</p>
<p>Human Centipede 2 &#8211; Filth. A cinematic crime. Offensive and disgusting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I may have mentioned this before, but there are too many things. And by &#8220;things&#8221; I mean books, video games, movies, TV shows, board games, songs, apps, and any other media one might experience. Right now, today, there are probably more things that I&#8217;d like to have a look at than I have time remaining in my life to do so. And tomorrow, someone will add even more.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to leave things unfinished, no loose ends. But now I have this frayed blanket of partially read books, half-watched shows, unfinished video games, barely messed with apps, and board games still in shrink wrap. At one point these things were rare and hard won. As a child I created an impromptu garage sale to fund the purchase of the BattleTech board game, shutting the sale down the moment I could afford to buy. And then I played BattleTech for ages. Now everything is so easy to obtain, effortlessly plucked from the ether. But I feel like it takes a greater force of will to slow down and appreciate a single thing, knowing there are thousands more awaiting my attention. It is like touring the Louvre in a formula one race car.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided I need to shift my perception of all this media, or at least to try. I&#8217;m trying to see it as another planetary ecosystem, something vast and ever present. In the same way that I do not need to play with every breed of dog on the planet, I do not need to play every game. If I see one I like, I will pet it and enjoy that moment. I&#8217;m really happy just knowing that all those things are out there and that sometimes my path will intersect with some of them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tree of Life is a meditation on God, family, growing, the meaning of life, a lot of things. I&#8217;m not going to review the film or go into my specific impressions of it as it is something you need to experience for yourself. The film is primarily a series of evocative visual scenes with little dialogue, so it would be like me describing <em>Guernica</em> when you ought to just go look at the painting.</p>
<p>During the pre-show, they showed clips from Sagan&#8217;s &#8220;Pale Blue Dot.&#8221; One of his closing challenges was to examine the arrogance of claiming that the universe was created for humans or one particular religion or subgroup. </p>
<p>Asking &#8220;Is there a God?&#8221; is a very human-centric question that seems ridiculous in the context of a universe that is absolutely not human. Humanity comprises an incalculably tiny part of all existence. Why does it even make sense to ask such questions? We are <em>part </em>of something gigantic, not set above it.</p>
<p>From my point of view, belief or disbelief in God are both necessary. The impact of the belief in God is the equivalent of there being a God, just as the impact of disbelief in God is the equivalent of there being no God. The effects of these beliefs are real and measurable. The questions &#8220;Is there a God?&#8221; or &#8220;Is God real?&#8221; are irrelevant.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to see Pixar&#8217;s WALL-E, there was an animated short called Partly Cloudy before the film. It had to do with a stork who got stuck with delivering really challenging packages. It got me thinking of some shadowy agency which employed people called Storks to deliver metaphorical packages to people. Perhaps this guy shows up on your doorstep with a lost memory from childhood.</p>
<p>Then I thought maybe I could make a role playing game out of it. The players would play characters in this agency delivering packages as a way of working off a debt, kind of like the reapers in Dead Like Me.</p>
<p>But then it occurred to me it might be more interesting if it were a live action game like Killer or Capture the Flag, where teams of people had to make sure a package got delivered to its destination.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how it happened, but when I sat down to write down some notes for the rules to this potential game, I instead wrote the manual that became The Stork. It was one of those rare pieces of writing that I transcribe more than write. It just flowed out, almost fully formed. I made some tweaks to it, but the first draft ended up being really good as is.</p>
<p>Some part of me wants to create these shared experiences, these abstract dreamlike ideas. I&#8217;ve found the best way to communicate them is to squeeze them into the shape of a story or a game. The structure is just a handle or a frame, a label so that other people can (hopefully) understand what I&#8217;m trying to tell them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix has been a huge part of my effort to declutter the media in my life. I have almost eliminated all physical DVDs from my &#8220;stuff&#8221;.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, Netflix Instant Watch is one of the greatest things ever. It&#8217;s how you know you&#8217;re in the 21st century. Each week it rises from an ocean of cinema and spreads a net of glittering gems recovered from the depths.<span id="more-2197"></span>Here are some of the more noteworthy experiences that I encourage you to check out for yourself.</p>
<p>This American Life &#8211; The two seasons of this show are every bit as poignant and masterful as the audio program.</p>
<p>Dear Zachary &#8211; A documentary about the depths of human evil and the saint-like goodness people are capable of.</p>
<p>Avatar the Last Airbender &#8211; I cannot say enough about how important and excellent this series is. One of the best, fully realized stories ever brought to television.</p>
<p>TiMER &#8211; Really great social sci-fi about dating and relationships.</p>
<p>That Mitchell and Webb Look &#8211; British sketch comedy at its finest. Balances between the absurdity of The Mighty Boosh and the crassness of Little Britain.</p>
<p>Below &#8211; A submarine thriller written by Aronofsky and directed by David Twohy.</p>
<p>Me and You and Everyone We Know &#8211; I fell hard for Miranda July and I wish she made more films.</p>
<p>I am a Sex Addict &#8211; Incredibly compelling autobiography.</p>
<p>A Town Called Panic &#8211; I had already seen this in the theater, but it was just as delightful the second time around. Imaginative and hysterical.</p>
<p>Cashback &#8211; A guy with insomnia gets a job at a supermarket. He then realizes he has the ability to stop time.</p>
<p>Zero Effect &#8211; This is one of those defining Bill Pullman movies.</p>
<p>The Secret of Kells &#8211; I had to see this because it was nominated for an academy award in animation and I had never heard of it.</p>
<p>Son of Rambow &#8211; Pure joy. A reconnection with vibrant childhood creativity.</p>
<p>Dead Like Me &#8211; This is one of those shows that everyone raves about and I think &#8220;Yeah, yeah, it can&#8217;t be *that* amazing.&#8221; But it is. Rube is one of the greatest characters since Deadwood&#8217;s Al Swearengen.</p>
<p>Wristcutters: A Love Story &#8211; A black comedy that takes place in the special limbo reserved for those who commit suicide.</p>
<p>Exit Through the Gift Shop &#8211; Just as amazing as advertised. A commentary on what constitutes art.</p>
<p>Valhalla Rising &#8211; A meditation on the decline of old religions and the arrival of Christianity. Felt like a tangent from Gaiman&#8217;s American Gods.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Still Here &#8211; Knowing the history of this documentary actually made it more relevant and moving.</p>
<p>This Film is Not Yet Rated &#8211; A revealing documentary about the MPAA and the completely bizarre and mysterious process by which films receive their rating.</p>
<p>Cold Souls &#8211; I can&#8217;t believe I had never heard of this movie. Reaffirms Paul Giamatti as one of our great under appreciated actors. His performance in just the first few minutes of the movie took my breath away.</p>
<p>Superman/Batman: Apocalypse &#8211; Like Justice League: New Frontier, this is a comic book movie done right. Mature storytelling, solid writing, great action.</p>
<p>16 Years of Alcohol &#8211; Kevin McKidd&#8217;s defining performance. It puts Bunraku in stark contrast, revealing just how much talent was wasted on that film.</p>
<p>Louie: Louis C.K.&#8217;s refinement of the Seinfeld formula. The show is very funny but so depressing it hurts. Yet I can&#8217;t look away.</p>
