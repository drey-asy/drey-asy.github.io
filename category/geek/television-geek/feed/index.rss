				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I may have mentioned this before, but there are too many things. And by &#8220;things&#8221; I mean books, video games, movies, TV shows, board games, songs, apps, and any other media one might experience. Right now, today, there are probably more things that I&#8217;d like to have a look at than I have time remaining in my life to do so. And tomorrow, someone will add even more.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to leave things unfinished, no loose ends. But now I have this frayed blanket of partially read books, half-watched shows, unfinished video games, barely messed with apps, and board games still in shrink wrap. At one point these things were rare and hard won. As a child I created an impromptu garage sale to fund the purchase of the BattleTech board game, shutting the sale down the moment I could afford to buy. And then I played BattleTech for ages. Now everything is so easy to obtain, effortlessly plucked from the ether. But I feel like it takes a greater force of will to slow down and appreciate a single thing, knowing there are thousands more awaiting my attention. It is like touring the Louvre in a formula one race car.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided I need to shift my perception of all this media, or at least to try. I&#8217;m trying to see it as another planetary ecosystem, something vast and ever present. In the same way that I do not need to play with every breed of dog on the planet, I do not need to play every game. If I see one I like, I will pet it and enjoy that moment. I&#8217;m really happy just knowing that all those things are out there and that sometimes my path will intersect with some of them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix has been a huge part of my effort to declutter the media in my life. I have almost eliminated all physical DVDs from my &#8220;stuff&#8221;.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, Netflix Instant Watch is one of the greatest things ever. It&#8217;s how you know you&#8217;re in the 21st century. Each week it rises from an ocean of cinema and spreads a net of glittering gems recovered from the depths.<span id="more-2197"></span>Here are some of the more noteworthy experiences that I encourage you to check out for yourself.</p>
<p>This American Life &#8211; The two seasons of this show are every bit as poignant and masterful as the audio program.</p>
<p>Dear Zachary &#8211; A documentary about the depths of human evil and the saint-like goodness people are capable of.</p>
<p>Avatar the Last Airbender &#8211; I cannot say enough about how important and excellent this series is. One of the best, fully realized stories ever brought to television.</p>
<p>TiMER &#8211; Really great social sci-fi about dating and relationships.</p>
<p>That Mitchell and Webb Look &#8211; British sketch comedy at its finest. Balances between the absurdity of The Mighty Boosh and the crassness of Little Britain.</p>
<p>Below &#8211; A submarine thriller written by Aronofsky and directed by David Twohy.</p>
<p>Me and You and Everyone We Know &#8211; I fell hard for Miranda July and I wish she made more films.</p>
<p>I am a Sex Addict &#8211; Incredibly compelling autobiography.</p>
<p>A Town Called Panic &#8211; I had already seen this in the theater, but it was just as delightful the second time around. Imaginative and hysterical.</p>
<p>Cashback &#8211; A guy with insomnia gets a job at a supermarket. He then realizes he has the ability to stop time.</p>
<p>Zero Effect &#8211; This is one of those defining Bill Pullman movies.</p>
<p>The Secret of Kells &#8211; I had to see this because it was nominated for an academy award in animation and I had never heard of it.</p>
<p>Son of Rambow &#8211; Pure joy. A reconnection with vibrant childhood creativity.</p>
<p>Dead Like Me &#8211; This is one of those shows that everyone raves about and I think &#8220;Yeah, yeah, it can&#8217;t be *that* amazing.&#8221; But it is. Rube is one of the greatest characters since Deadwood&#8217;s Al Swearengen.</p>
<p>Wristcutters: A Love Story &#8211; A black comedy that takes place in the special limbo reserved for those who commit suicide.</p>
<p>Exit Through the Gift Shop &#8211; Just as amazing as advertised. A commentary on what constitutes art.</p>
<p>Valhalla Rising &#8211; A meditation on the decline of old religions and the arrival of Christianity. Felt like a tangent from Gaiman&#8217;s American Gods.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Still Here &#8211; Knowing the history of this documentary actually made it more relevant and moving.</p>
<p>This Film is Not Yet Rated &#8211; A revealing documentary about the MPAA and the completely bizarre and mysterious process by which films receive their rating.</p>
<p>Cold Souls &#8211; I can&#8217;t believe I had never heard of this movie. Reaffirms Paul Giamatti as one of our great under appreciated actors. His performance in just the first few minutes of the movie took my breath away.</p>
<p>Superman/Batman: Apocalypse &#8211; Like Justice League: New Frontier, this is a comic book movie done right. Mature storytelling, solid writing, great action.</p>
<p>16 Years of Alcohol &#8211; Kevin McKidd&#8217;s defining performance. It puts Bunraku in stark contrast, revealing just how much talent was wasted on that film.</p>
<p>Louie: Louis C.K.&#8217;s refinement of the Seinfeld formula. The show is very funny but so depressing it hurts. Yet I can&#8217;t look away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had this whole post mentally queued up about the nature of internet celebrity re: Penny Arcade vs. Jordan, Jesse, Go! but I&#8217;ve had a bit of wine, so it will need to be tabled for later. Instead, let me tell you about the fantastic Monte Cubano sandwiches I made tonight. As is tradition, we gather at Nick and Amanda&#8217;s to watch Lost. But first we have fancy sandwiches. Tonight I faced the challenge of preparing the sandwiches. I&#8217;m making a note here: Huge Success.</p>
<p>What is the recipe, you ask? Look no further than the wonderful Epicurious: <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Monte-Cubano-351851" target="_blank">click here for awesome sandwiches</a></p>
<p>Also, have you seen that amazing OK Go video for This Too Shall Pass?</p>

<p>Unless the quality takes a serious turn in season 3, I&#8217;m in it for the duration.</p>

Beyond just superb sound design, the shows are edifying in a way that makes me feel better about the world in general. Also, if Ira Glass and Jad Abumrad interviewed each other, my mind would explode.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not the most stellar of premieres, but it was wonderful to see that spinning blue box again.</p>
<p>And another season of Torchwood comes to a close. I hope that in season three they sort out their issue with a cohesive arc that has a more meaningful impact on the finale. So far the showrunners have peppered something of an arc randomly through different episodes and then have &#8220;plotlines&#8221; I was unaware of suddenly come together completely out of nowhere. While I like the big arcs other shows have, Torchwood is really about each of character&#8217;s plotline. That&#8217;s what I find myself caring about the most.</p>
<p>I started Haibane Renmei again. I had started on the fansub years ago and then gotten distracted.</p>
