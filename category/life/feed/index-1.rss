				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was holding off on posting in my blog because I am going to be moving web hosts, but that has been delayed due to a mixup.</p>
<p>The STAPLE pre-party was neat. I had forgotten how many comic books there were at Austin Books &amp; Comics. It felt like an ark for comic books, a backup vault in case civilization fell. I didn&#8217;t really know anyone there besides Chris, but my &#8220;Team Linus&#8221; shirt served as social currency. I also got to meet Goatboy, the artist who did the interior art for The Stork. I had only worked with him online.</p>
<p>Then I went to Reed&#8217;s housewarming party where I talked to cute girls about Doctor Who. Cory brought New Age and fruit, pretty much sealing the deal on the fun party situation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, starting tomorrow, my Google calendar looks like a blocky cross section of the Funtime Mountains or the EEG readout of the Busytown heartbeat. Lots going on. Planned soirées and the like. It resembles a <em>social </em>person&#8217;s schedule, as opposed to a Netflix hermit.<span id="more-68"></span></p>
<p>Tomorrow night is the STAPLE pre-party at Austin Books and Comics. I&#8217;m going to roll in there like I know what is going on. But I don&#8217;t know what to say to a room full of indie comic writers. I&#8217;ll hang out there until I feel awkward and then bounce over to Reed and Laura Lee&#8217;s housewarming party.</p>
<p>Saturday is all about STAPLE. Got to get up early, drag some products over to the convention center, check in, find my table and act like I know what I am doing. My plan is to set up House of Whack and invite people to play. Also, I will trick people into paying $1 for The Stork when it is actually worth $1.45! Ha ha! No idea what to expect. I&#8217;ve never done an expo for reals and I don&#8217;t know if I can deal with sitting at a booth all day.</p>
<p>After that, there are several events that I will attempt to hit, depending on my energy level. My friend Jonathan is having a birthday party, there is the STAPLE BBQ dinner and the STAPLE after party. It will be at a club with a DJ, so I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Sunday evening brings Fiction Circus. It&#8217;s a thing.</p>
<p>Monday = take a breath.</p>
<p>Tuesday is Boards &#8216;N Brews. That night&#8217;s double feature is Dungeon Lords and Cosmic Encounter.</p>
<p>Wednesday = dork around online.</p>
<p>Thursday promises an interesting mixer for the Austin Geocachers Meetup, followed by my friend Reed&#8217;s band, World Racketeering Squad at Headhunters.</p>
<p>Friday = video games.</p>
<p>Come Saturday and SXSW will start to ramp up. While I am not attending the insane industry fame fest proper, I will be checking out peripheral parties and events, like the one put on by io9 and Gawker media. MC Frontalot and Stormtroopers!</p>
<p>Sunday finds me hanging out with friends.</p>
<p>Monday there is a Meetup for all the Meetup organizers hosted by the Meetup bigwigs in town for SXSW. Supposedly we will be discussing strategies. My meetup is awesome, so I&#8217;m not sure what I will take home from it except maybe some beers in my belly.</p>
<p>The rest of the week is a question mark. Chances are I will check out a few SXSW things, but more likely stay at home.</p>
<p>Then there is a big lull the following week right before PAX East. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. By all accounts, this looks like it will be the geek convention suited for me. I probably won&#8217;t do GenCon again and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll ever do a ComiCon or E3. But PAX seems like the perfect blend of those things.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I brought House of Whack to Boards &#8216;n Brews. It was good to see it on the table again. I hadn&#8217;t taught the game to new players in ages, but this was the smoothest explanation so far. There were four players, a really good size group for newcomers. We played the straight up &#8220;Inside the Box&#8221; version with nothing fancy. The Throne of Swift and Whimsical Judgment came into play and there was a pretty amusing trial as a result. Dan had a legitimate beef with Jeff, namely being forced to stand while playing and walk around in a circle. The jury was split and it came down to a roll off, which Jeff won. That&#8217;s how it goes down sometimes.</p>
<p>Jeff pulled ahead of everyone on the score track and took home a copy of the game. Good times!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like there&#8217;s a flurry of activity in every facet of my life.  If I were ruler of some mystical kingdom just beyond the Scintillating Sea, I might take a survey of my domain.  I would discover the palace architects busy with a strange House that kept changing appearance and dimensions.  The money counters are wringing their hands, suggesting we tax the peasants more, raid several neighboring kingdoms for gold, or at least beseech those that tread in heavenly realms for a boon.  The royal chef is preparing strange foreign meals for the king&#8217;s whimsical diet.  The High Dreamers awake daily to record detailed accounts of their journeys through the sliding seafoam beaches of silver worlds.  New orders arrive regularly for the court artists, requests for portraits and windows that burn with cryptic sigils.  The ambassador entertains queens visiting from faraway realms while the jester dances with the cats.  The king stands in his empty bedchamber and stares out across the landscape, imagining a quiet cottage on a hill where none of the clocks work.</p>
