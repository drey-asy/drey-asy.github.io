				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am writing to you all simultaneously. Not everything I have to say is specifically about you, but you are important to me and I wanted to include you. It may help to think of what I have to say in metaphorical terms, an analogy. If you are from where I am from, you can also take it literally.</p>
<p>Years ago I lived in a world where several timelines rubbed together like strips of film from different versions of the same movie. I saw different layers of information. Rough winds of feelings and possibilities blasted through my head and heart. I often felt a sliding sensation, as though I had stepped onto a conveyor belt. Sometimes gravity started to behave differently. I moved through a realm of constant dreams and voices, trying to pull meaning from it. These are all translations for experiences I was never able to articulate to other people or find someone who related with them.</p>
<p>Having what feels like a fundamentally different experience of reality than other people around me was like always being in a glass box floating at the edge of other people&#8217;s vision. Isolated and not quite there. Being able to see too much information about other people made it hard to have lasting relationships. I didn&#8217;t give them a chance. I didn&#8217;t want to waste anyone&#8217;s time with a relationship that was already over in my mind.</p>
<p>I decided to fix it. I decided to change. I wanted to learn how to disconnect the other worlds and be normal. Over the course of a year or so, I followed instructions that came to me like old memories. Each step lead me to the next step. One step came from a trampoline (and, perhaps, from Trampoline). Through the use of LSD I was able to manifest my metaphorical operating system to disconnect and rewire things. It was like a light had been switched off  and I came to an abrupt halt without knowing I had been moving so fast all this time.</p>
<p>And so life started to happen Now and there wasn&#8217;t any other sort of time. No other worlds blobbed over my vision. No freight trains of possibility rocketed past inches away from my head. I could focus more and be part of the world other people inhabited. I got what I thought I wanted. But something kept nagging at me, like a task I kept forgetting about. There was a banging sound inside me, faint and distant, against thick glass, perhaps underwater. Eventually, when I looked inside me, I discovered the banging was me, on the inside of the floating glass box. I hadn&#8217;t changed myself at all. I had just changed places with someone else.</p>
<p>Maybe it had been a mistake to disconnect myself. It&#8217;s hard to say. The amalgam of previous moments culminates in who we are now and all that. I just knew that on some level I was unhappy. I had sacrificed part of myself so that I could walk instead of floating like a weirdo. Despite my unhappiness, I was convinced that this was the only version of myself that would be accepted by my friends. One of you has Seen me before. You know how difficult it can be.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to take the thing you&#8217;ve been making, the thing that isn&#8217;t getting better by adding more parts or twisting the knobs, and smash it. The parts that survive are the strongest and they can be reused for something else. Many years ago I jumped out the window of a very tall Las Vegas hotel. I did not survive. But that was the point. It was the only way to rebuild and keep living.</p>
<p>So a week or so ago  I did mushrooms in order to receive the next set of instructions on how to undo what I had done. The metaphor was kind of funny and on point. During the trip, while I was in the bathroom, I pulled up my underwear. I saw the lettering on the waistband was inverted, as though in a mirror. A sticker that had been on one hand was now on the other. As I stood up I had the sensation of standing upside down on the ceiling. The quality of light had changed. I was on the other side of the glass. I went outside and looked at a new sky. And then the trains started running again and the winds started blowing. It comes in flashes now, a trip to the grocery store suddenly a challenging task of navigating pocket universes.</p>
<p>I was also given the next step in my instructions. At some point my fingers will turn into something that looks like a gun, a blue, glowing mystical barrel. I&#8217;m not sure what will happen, but I get the sense that part of me will die, like in Vegas, and I will move on with what is left. You&#8217;ve seen enough Doctor Who to know that these transitions are difficult but ultimately survivable. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So that is what has been going on with me. I thought you should know. As for other recent developments that I have been processing, I&#8217;ve been of several minds.</p>
<div style="width: 46%; padding-right: 2%; float: left; font-size: 14px !important; line-height: 1.4em;">I am grateful for every moment and I know I cannot keep you. I want you in my life as long as possible, whatever shape that takes. Thank you for being so brave and generous as you share your life with me on this adventure. You have grown so much in the time I have known you and I like to think I contributed to your growth in some way. I really do want you to be happy and it would be selfish of me to put any sort of parameters on your happiness, even if that means you won&#8217;t always be with me.</div>
<div style="width: 46%; padding-left: 2%; float: left; font-size: 14px !important; line-height: 1.4em;">When I think of you marrying someone else, I get so angry. It just shatters me. I had no plan for my life other than being with you. I feel like an idiot for facilitating this whole arrangement. I feel that so many people I have loved have just used me as a stepping stone to move on to some happier stage of their life. I&#8217;m never the one who is chosen. I am the one that gets left behind. It&#8217;s hard to always be the guy you were &#8220;happy to have known&#8221; and who helped make you a better person. I want to be with that better person, not have them go off with someone else.</div>
<div style="padding-top: 10px; clear: both;"></div>
<p>I used to think that there was someone I was meant to be with, like a soulmate. If I was patient enough, I would encounter her. But maybe I&#8217;m not meant for anyone, or not just one person in particular. Maybe that is okay.</p>
<p>Come what may, know that I love you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So one of my creative projects is my ongoing quest to find a girlfriend. I will go into more detail in a future post. This week is just the preamble, the tease. The <em>real </em>posts start next week.</p>
<p>Anyhow, one of my friends from my board game group suddenly got engaged. I&#8217;m not best buds with the guy or anything, not privy to the machinations of his private life. But still. Seems like I would have noticed someone he was about to marry. Turns out it was someone he had known for a while, but she lives in Seattle. And they decided to get married this coming July and he&#8217;s going to move out there. Just like that.</p>
<p>So another friend asks me if I found the love of my life but she lived somewhere else, wouldn&#8217;t I move there? Like what if she was from Ohio. Would I go back there? And I&#8217;m like &#8220;Fuck, I hope not. I hope it doesn&#8217;t come down to that.&#8221; I love Austin. I love my friends here. I don&#8217;t want to leave. She&#8217;d have to move here.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the main reasons I came here was to hopefully meet someone in Austin, the cool town with the Alamo Drafthouse. I don&#8217;t want to find out that, no, she&#8217;s actually kicking it in some Louisiana bayou or New York borough. I don&#8217;t think it is wrong to balance the fantastic with the pragmatic, the deep soul desire with the practicality of the everyday.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, some mirror cracks open or an alien shuttle craft lands and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s bail on this whole planet Earth situation and go back to my place.&#8221; I&#8217;d be down with that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get this guilt from not having the Next Big Thing queued up. The Project is what I use to validate my existence. But I&#8217;m waiting for someone, guys. None of this makes a lot of sense without her.  I feel like I got to do most of the things I wanted to do on my own.</p>
<p>Now I just want to do things with you and with her.</p>
<p>But sometimes you&#8217;re busy and she&#8230; She&#8217;s taking her time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This started out as a post about PAX East 2010, but then I realized I had no interest or energy to recount that adventure. In summary: Geek cons are fun, exhausting and one day too long.</p>
<p>When I go to a convention, especially one in the realm of geekiness, I usually find myself fending off an encroaching wave of depression and estrangement. I think it is most prevalent at conventions because I feel like, of all social groups, I should find resonance with <em>this </em>one. But I don&#8217;t. It doesn&#8217;t happen with any group, anywhere, ever. I have no people.<span id="more-20"></span></p>
<p>In the past I attributed this feeling to something flawed in me or something inherently misaligned in the interface between myself and social groups. But, at PAX, I realized what was actually happening. I looked at all the people hanging out with their friends, eating together, showing each other cool games, etc. I thought, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this alone. This isn&#8217;t fun by myself.&#8221; And then I realized that I wasn&#8217;t just talking about PAX, I was talking about my life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting companionship for a long time now, but I didn&#8217;t realize what its lack was doing in my life. I naturally want to be loved and to love someone else. But I&#8217;ve been getting by without that. Except that I&#8217;m not really getting by. In every social interaction there is an unconscious expectation that whomever I&#8217;m speaking to will somehow fulfill my need for love. It could be my friends, someone I&#8217;m playing a board game with, a meetup group I go to, the waitress at the restaurant&#8230; And they fail to give me what I need. Because it is unfair to expect it and I didn&#8217;t even know that I was asking for anything. And so I have been constantly disappointed and estranged and puzzled about why I am so discontented with other people.</p>
<p>Having identified this does not make me feel any better. But it does give me hope that some day I will have fulfillment in my life and I won&#8217;t leave every table still feeling hungry.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I wish I could just date. Sometimes I wish I could just be the person she needed, whoever &#8220;she&#8221; happened to be at the time. Sometimes I want to ignore the extra layer of information I see superimposed over the world, my soul&#8217;s HUD for navigating waking life. But the pull of that silver path is too strong. And I <em>want</em> to follow it, even if it leads to my nemesis. No one wants to face rejection because of an aetheric arrow. No one wants to hear about time out of phase. My criteria is beyond unreasonable and I find this offends those who hear it. Simply put: She lights up. And I &#8230; ignite.</p>
<p>So this is an apology to all of the wonderful women who just seem so right, who just make so much sense. I&#8217;m sorry. Just think of me as a visitor to your planet, bound by alien directives and customs. It will be easier to explain my behavior that way. I&#8217;m sorry. You did not stand a chance against the avatar, the one I am moving toward as the sun moves toward the sea. I don&#8217;t want you to save me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m driving the BMW to Trader Joe&#8217;s. Beth is next to me. I notice that the experience of the car is transformed by who is handling it, much that of a gun or violin. Here the vehicle is purely utilitarian, getting us to where we need to go. I don&#8217;t care what it looks like or what it <em>is </em>and I only think about it in terms of how the BMW is not like my own car.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about relationships and online dating. I haven&#8217;t given Beth the backstory of the avatar, so the things I say apparently horrify her on some level. I haven&#8217;t encountered many people who are comfortable with the rhetoric of the quirkyalone. Listening to myself, I know it sounds like I have excluded the entire world save one person.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pushing the shopping cart at Trader Joe&#8217;s and reality has gone wobbly for me. I start to lose focus on where I am and suddenly I am in several different stores at once. Beth is asking me something about the grocery list, which has suddenly become indecipherable, the scrawled prescription from a mad chef. I answer noncommittally as the aisles telescope and emotions tumble down the shelves.</p>
<p>We manage to collect the ingredients for guacamole and hummus, dips which Beth insists must never be purchased, always made by hand. Later she would demonstrate her Shaolin avacado cutting style. She has resolved to eat an avacado a day while in California. I also found the frozen chocolate dipped bananas I had been craving.</p>
<p>The ride back is just like the ride there, only in reverse. Which is to say, completely unfamiliar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;m putting this profile out there as a kind of beacon for the person who is looking for me. A single white stone forming a path leading to me.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I will continue as though you are that one person.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Hello, (your name goes here). I am overjoyed to finally meet you. I have been searching for you for years. I&#8217;ve seen you flickering in the corner of my eye, in dreams, in smiles, always ephemeral and fleeting. But now, here you are. You are beautiful and extraordinary.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I want to know everything that happened to you up until this moment. I want you to tell me what you&#8217;ve figured out about life. All the mistakes and triumphs. I will tell you my story as well. This will all take some time, so I figure we can spread it out across many conversations over coffee, in the car, at dinner, in bed, on airplanes, in sofa forts, after movies, during arguments, and even during our silences.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">We both came all this way. There will always be distances to cross, but I&#8217;m committed to cross them with you.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Let&#8217;s not date. Let&#8217;s not &#8220;be friends first and see where things go.&#8221; What if we talk about what we truly want out of a partner and then work to make that happen? Let&#8217;s have an adventure! Let us be extraordinary lovers and constant friends. Why not?</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I won&#8217;t give you any disclaimers and I expect none in return. It is true, things happened to us in the past, threads that wove us into what we are now. I want to know you, but I never want to understand you. I never want to figure you out, if that is even possible. I want to create a relationship where we are constantly exploring who we are to each other.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I&#8217;ve been looking all over for you, but now I need to stay still in one place and wait for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Please don&#8217;t be too long.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Find me.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>
