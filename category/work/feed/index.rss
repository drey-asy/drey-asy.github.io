<p>I&#8217;m pretty good at keeping secrets. You ask me not to tell, I essentially partition that information away in a special vault in my memory. Eventually even I will be surprised by the news.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tricky when I am working on something cool, but I&#8217;m forbidden to show anyone. I recently had to sign an NDA at work. Now I belong to a secret society who know about *It*.</p>
<p>In other news, I have secured three video testimonials about The Stork. I want to get one more and then cut together a promo video so I can launch the Kickstarter project. I&#8217;d like to get that going by the end of the month.</p>
