<p>I&#8217;m working my way through all of the male characters and then I&#8217;ll do the females. Today I rendered out all the images for The Duel and started dabbling with designing each of the House planets. There are still a ton of Treachery cards to create.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been physically depressed for weeks now. Makes it tough to get much done, even this post. I&#8217;ve started logging my sleep to see if I need to make any adjustments there.</p>
<p>Still working on images for the Dune game. I realized that I had completely forgotten to include the cards from the Spice Harvest expansion in my list of components. They are all pretty straightforward, but it is like three more decks of cards to do.</p>
<p>I have several collaborative projects in the works. I&#8217;ll see how they go. It is nice to have projects.</p>
<p>Went out with a really pretty redhead a few weeks ago, but she said there was no chemistry. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember when I was working on House of Whack I could just sit there and create graphics for ten hours at a time. And I didn&#8217;t feel it. Time just blew past. Lately I&#8217;ve been noticing that it is hard to stay focused on any one thing, be it a job at work, a personal project, video games, TV shows, whatever. Part of it is an energy thing. I&#8217;m tired and unmotivated much of the time. After sitting at a computer for eight hours at work, it is a tough sell to tell myself &#8220;Okay, now it is time to be creative! Let&#8217;s sit in front of the computer some more!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another part of it is I feel like I&#8217;ve got to get it all done, see it all, play it all, before&#8230;what? Before I die? Before I&#8217;m in a relationship? I don&#8217;t know. So, unconsciously, I was becoming very results oriented, wanting to get to the end as quickly as possible. I really need to relax and enjoy the process of whatever I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been learning some new software so I can create illustrations of the characters for the Dune game. Learning digital tools is like learning new spells. I want to be able to summon the floating palace right away, but first I need to learn how to push little stone blocks around. My mind cracks open with the possibilities and then is daunted by all there is to learn. There&#8217;s already so much information in my head.</p>
<p>Ugh, even finishing this post is getting to be a struggle. Sleepy sleepy&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least I think it is the third iteration. Maybe it is the fourth. In any case, I have updated the gateway to my small network of web sites. <a title="DreyNet" href="http://www.dreynet.com" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s take a quick tour</a>.</p>
<p>The home page is a rotating gateway to each site. The sites can also be accessed from the main menu. You will also note a link called &#8220;The Latest&#8221;. That&#8217;s where I will display my most recently completed projects (stories, games, videos, etc.). Social media hooks are in full effect with the tweetbox on the right and a &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; tab displaying numerous online destinations to satisfy your cyber-stalking pleasure.</p>
<p>On to the individual sites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andremonserrat.com" target="_blank">First Time Flowing</a> &#8211; My blog. No doubt you are familiar with this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreampunk.com/" target="_blank">DreamPunk Productions</a> &#8211; This is my &#8220;game and story-shaped design&#8221; studio, home of <a href="http://www.whatisthestork.com/" target="_blank">The Stork</a> and <a href="http://www.houseofwhack.net/" target="_blank">House of Whack</a>. Speaking of which, those each have their own site.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreynet.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=In_Between" target="_blank">In Between</a> &#8211; This is a wiki I made to keep track of all the worlds and characters I have created over the years. Managing several universes is a challenging task.</p>
<p>There is another somewhat hidden site, which can be discovered by <a href="http://www.andremonserrat.com/category/life/avatar-life/" target="_blank">the person looking for me</a>.</p>
<p>And there we are, back at the start!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in Seattle this weekend, so no time for a big post. I&#8217;m in the process of consolidating and revamping my network of sites. My personal page has always had a gallery of my artwork and this iteration is no exception. This time I have reached way back into the vaults and pulled out some really old stuff to join the more recent works.</p>
<p>By default, the page loads all of the artwork, but you can browse by category as well. Click on a thumbnail to get a larger version.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while I&#8217;ll get an idea in my head and it  jumps up and down, bullying the other ideas and becomes a general nuisance until I give it my attention. I can feel other stories and projects behind the idea, but I can&#8217;t get to them until I address the one at the fore. Sometimes it is just a matter of writing down some notes while other times I need to follow it through to completion.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the idea that got in the way was Sküb, a despicable storytelling game featuring a bad, bad dog. Basically a re-imagining of Scooby Doo and the gang as a hellhound and his thralls. It was evil and wrong and I hope you&#8217;ll play it some day. I got enough of it down to clear the way for other things.</p>
<p>The newest logjam is the result of an idea for a music video. Completely impractical and expensive. I&#8217;ll at least need to storyboard it and sketch out the ridiculous device required for it to work. Then I can see what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>Brief Updates:</p>
<p>I had a powwow with Cory, an expert designer, someone capable of translating ideas into functioning objects. I had only wispy concepts of how I thought the board for the Dune game could be constructed. He had names for all of the parts required. I insisted that he illustrate and write them all down for future reference. Incidentally, he is also constructing a custom Dune set, though with more ambitious production values.</p>
<p>The Stork is at the printer. The printer erred of the side of caution and sent me a new proof with a different color calibration. I found it even more accurate than the previous iteration.</p>
<p>The frame for my movie screen is complete. I replaced the generic lamp with a more steampunky version. I still need to re-skin the small couch and the chairs to match the decor. Also, I envision a curtain dividing the living room and the dining nook.</p>
<p>I have re-purposed a cabinet and some random bricks into a backyard garden. I still need dirt and, well, something to plant. Tomatoes, I think. They are pretty forgiving.</p>
<p>That is all for now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I met someone who was interested in doing a collaborative photo project. We met at a mostly deserted train station and took photos of things that interested us. My idea was that we&#8217;d look at what we had shot and a narrative would unfold.<span id="more-2411"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/grey-parrot1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2480" title="grey-parrot" src="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/grey-parrot1-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" srcset="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/grey-parrot1-224x300.jpg 224w, http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/grey-parrot1-200x267.jpg 200w, http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/grey-parrot1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a>We emailed each other our photos. I hadn&#8217;t noticed the poster until I saw it in one of her photos. The train station was desolate, saturated with a sense of lost potential. This plea for not simply a lost parrot, but for the lost man who found the lost parrot, found here in this lost train station, inspired an idea of this nexus of missing things.</p>
<p>I created this image and sent it to her with the opening line &#8220;So many things went missing that day,&#8221; hoping she would continue the story with a photo and line of her own. Alas, she did not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a short status report on where various projects stand&#8230;<span id="more-2258"></span></p>
<p>The Stork &#8211; It looks like the payments got processed sooner than expected, so I can potentially have the book printed several weeks sooner. I&#8217;ve completed the special Kickstarter edition of the book. I&#8217;ll give it another once over before sending it to the printer. I will be setting up a more involved web site for The Stork (and probably revamping all of my existing sites as well).</p>
<p>Dune &#8211; I discovered that there are typos that have been present since the original Avalon Hill edition of the game. I have updated the board with the &#8220;real&#8221; locations on Arrakis (Old Gap instead of OH Gap, Plaster Basin instead of Plastic Basin).</p>
<p>Talisman Revised rules &#8211; The play test session went really well and the new rules made the game more fun. Even though it made the game play faster turn by turn, it still took the usual 3 hours to finish the game.</p>
<p>House Mods/Redecorating &#8211; I now have a nice leather-looking storage ottoman to prop my feet up on as well as store Rock Band peripherals. Also, I had a small fire in the kitchen which caused some smoke damage. There is now a bright cobalt comic book-like BLAM shape painted over the ceiling and wall. I also added some more to the House of Whack mural thing I have going on in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Girlfriend &#8211; No measurable progress. I met a really fantastic woman with a fantastic life and house. No idea if she is into me or not. I spent a lot of time over-thinking it.</p>

As I did so, I started playing with textures, colors and effects. I went with more abstract outlines for the regions, more like something you&#8217;d see on a Risk board. My goal was to differentiate the types of regions and still maintain the desert planet look.</p>
<p>I still need to add some iconography and I may add additional texturing, but this is getting close to something I am really happy with.</p>
