				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I brought House of Whack to Boards &#8216;n Brews. It was good to see it on the table again. I hadn&#8217;t taught the game to new players in ages, but this was the smoothest explanation so far. There were four players, a really good size group for newcomers. We played the straight up &#8220;Inside the Box&#8221; version with nothing fancy. The Throne of Swift and Whimsical Judgment came into play and there was a pretty amusing trial as a result. Dan had a legitimate beef with Jeff, namely being forced to stand while playing and walk around in a circle. The jury was split and it came down to a roll off, which Jeff won. That&#8217;s how it goes down sometimes.</p>
<p>Jeff pulled ahead of everyone on the score track and took home a copy of the game. Good times!</p>
