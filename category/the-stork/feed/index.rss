<p>So&#8230;</p>
<p>The Stork &#8211; The file is off to the printer and I am awaiting a proof. If all looks good, I&#8217;ll have them do a run of 600 books.</p>
<p>I am in the process of revising and consolidating my various web sites. So look for some changes in the coming weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the time of this writing, The Stork has been funded for $1310, which is $210 above the goal. I am overjoyed and humbled and astonished by all of the support from friends and strangers alike.</p>
<p>But when it was only funded for $500, I felt the dread coming on. I worried that things wouldn&#8217;t work out and I&#8217;d let all these people down. I imagined all the sympathetic looks and the &#8220;ah, well at least you tried&#8221;s. I made up all kinds of things about what it might <em>mean </em>if the project didn&#8217;t get funded.</p>
<p>Then I recalled something someone said in a blog post a few weeks back. Excuse me, what <em>I</em> said in a blog post. About acting like it is a done deal and not giving up. A lot of things I write are directed at myself as much as they are towards other people. It is like having an emotional savings account to fall back on during rough patches.</p>
<p>So I decided that $500 was nearly halfway there. I decided that there was plenty of time and lots of people were just going to contribute later. I decided that someone was waiting until the right moment to make a dramatic contribution. As it turned out, all of these things were true.</p>
<p>I want to be less afraid. I want to trust any process I have set in motion. I want to have more faith in myself and in other people. It is happening, step by step, with the occasional explosion of wings unfurling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I want people to be braver and kinder. I want people to know how much they matter. I want people to get beyond their obstacles. But sometimes people are afraid or self-defeating or unaware of the impact they have. Sometimes they need a nudge. Sometimes people secretly want permission to be fantastic.</p>
<p>That’s why I created The Stork. It is permission to step outside your comfort zone, to be daring, to be silly, to see what it is like to not keep putting something off&#8230;whatever it is you need to give yourself permission to do.</p>
<p>And you can’t do it alone. The Stork is a game where you must interact with at least one other person in order to succeed. These moments, these glowing points of contact, cannot be encapsulated because they are different for everyone. But for me, the times I have been The Stork, I feel like I matter and I am reminded that I am capable of more than I’m currently settling for.</p>
<p>The Stork is entering its last week on Kickstarter and it still needs a bit more funding in order to succeed. Please visit the page and have a look at the project. If it resonates with you, please consider contributing $10 or $25 (or any amount) to keeping it alive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to see Pixar&#8217;s WALL-E, there was an animated short called Partly Cloudy before the film. It had to do with a stork who got stuck with delivering really challenging packages. It got me thinking of some shadowy agency which employed people called Storks to deliver metaphorical packages to people. Perhaps this guy shows up on your doorstep with a lost memory from childhood.</p>
<p>Then I thought maybe I could make a role playing game out of it. The players would play characters in this agency delivering packages as a way of working off a debt, kind of like the reapers in Dead Like Me.</p>
<p>But then it occurred to me it might be more interesting if it were a live action game like Killer or Capture the Flag, where teams of people had to make sure a package got delivered to its destination.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how it happened, but when I sat down to write down some notes for the rules to this potential game, I instead wrote the manual that became The Stork. It was one of those rare pieces of writing that I transcribe more than write. It just flowed out, almost fully formed. I made some tweaks to it, but the first draft ended up being really good as is.</p>
<p>Some part of me wants to create these shared experiences, these abstract dreamlike ideas. I&#8217;ve found the best way to communicate them is to squeeze them into the shape of a story or a game. The structure is just a handle or a frame, a label so that other people can (hopefully) understand what I&#8217;m trying to tell them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was hoping I would be able to share something about a recent project, but it is still under wraps. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty good at keeping secrets. You ask me not to tell, I essentially partition that information away in a special vault in my memory. Eventually even I will be surprised by the news.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tricky when I am working on something cool, but I&#8217;m forbidden to show anyone. I recently had to sign an NDA at work. Now I belong to a secret society who know about *It*.</p>
<p>In other news, I have secured three video testimonials about The Stork. I want to get one more and then cut together a promo video so I can launch the Kickstarter project. I&#8217;d like to get that going by the end of the month.</p>

Their back end is really slick and full of helpful information on fundraising, promoting your project, etc. I&#8217;m used to shrouding The Stork in secrecy so that it is more fun to learn about it when you participate. But, obviously, in this situation, I need to give more details so people understand why they should contribute.</p>
<p>Kickstarter encourages the use of video to help people engage with your project on an emotional level. I&#8217;m gathering video testimonials of people who have participated in the past so I can cut together a promo. So far I have two really good testimonials and I&#8217;d like to get at least two more. Then I&#8217;ll throw in some graphics and music and put it up!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kickstarter fever was in the air. It seemed like every time I turned around, someone was posting about their new Kickstarter project on Facebook or Twitter. It seemed like a magical box where you put an idea in one end and an amazing thing came out the other. Somewhere in between a bunch of generous strangers dumped a bunch of money in there as well.</p>
<p>The excitement and success stories surrounding Kickstarter projects made me want to <em>do it</em> like the cool kids. But what would I do? Of course! I could do an expanded print run of The Stork, my&#8230; game&#8230;book&#8230;experiment&#8230;thing. Yes! Kickstarter was the perfect place for my weird idea of promoting random kindness.<span id="more-71"></span></p>
<p>So I filled out the proposal, describing the book and the general concept and sent it off for review. As I waited, I began plotting out the logistics of the new print run, what sort of benefits I could offer, ways of promoting it, etc. In my mind, it was a done deal. I know it might sound like a lot of self-motivational-seminar bullshit, but acting like something is a done deal is a powerful way to make it so.</p>
<p>But a few days later&#8230;dum dum duuuuummm! An unexpected turn of events. They <em>rejected</em> my project, saying it wasn&#8217;t a good fit and best of luck to you and&#8230;what? Not a good fit? I was taken aback. I felt betrayed. It was like seeing Mr. Rogers rob a liquor store: an unforeseen gut punch to my world view. To see all these other projects get approved and then be told, &#8220;No, you don&#8217;t get to play with us&#8221; was truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I looked through some of the other games that had been approved by Kickstarter. One project sought $7800 for what amounted to some fancy maps for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Why was that a better fit than The Stork? Another guy had a game that was essentially a more adult version of Apples to Apples. Really? That got the okay?</p>
<p>So I wrote back, asking for an explanation. And this was their response:</p>
<p><em>?&#8221;With Kickstarter, it&#8217;s important to be able to communicate past experience, visual examples of your work, and a comprehensive plan to complete your project within a reasonably certain time-frame &#8212; projects at the very beginning stages are less successful because they are not able to do this. Something like this sounds exciting, but is not in an ideal position to benefit from our platform.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>When I got done being puzzled at their response, I saw what had happened and hope sprung in my heart:  They didn&#8217;t <em>get </em>it. They thought I had merely the glimmer of an idea, a &#8220;what if&#8221; scenario. I wrote back to explain that I could send them hard copy of my &#8220;beginning stages&#8221; in the form of a complete book. Would that be enough evidence to demonstrate I could finish the project within a reasonable time? My project was essentially already done. I just wanted to print more of it, print it with better quality and expose it to more people.</p>
<p>The next message was an apology for not comprehending what I wanted to do and a big green light of approval! So I am moving forward with a bigger and better print run of The Stork. It&#8217;s a done deal.</p>
<p>The lesson: If you cared enough to make it, fight for it. The thing you made is amazing, so do what it takes to keep it alive. When you give in to &#8220;No,&#8221; that&#8217;s not someone else taking away your project; it&#8217;s you smothering it while it sleeps.</p>
