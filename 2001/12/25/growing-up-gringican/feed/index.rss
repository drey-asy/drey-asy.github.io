		<description><![CDATA[Walt Disney has also thoroughly confused me with the goofy character. In the newer show, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, the love of goofy&#039;s life is Clarabelle the cow. Now I wonder if maybe goofy is not actually a cow living a double life as a dog. I also get confused with chip n dale. They are chipmunks. But then you have the chipendales. They are dancers. Very entertaining I might add. Then you have those Budweiser horses called Clydesdales, which, as a child, I mistakenly called chipndales. I now understand English must not be my first language.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow....That was the best read I have had in a very long time.  I think it&#039;s great that your father has told you stories about his life; my dad has done the same :)

I know this has been written in 2001, but I think it should be getting the attention it deserves even now.
Keep writing :)]]></description>
