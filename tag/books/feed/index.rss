				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somehow, no matter how long I read, the last centimeter or so of pages left in the book did not diminish. I guess I didn&#8217;t want it to end. I&#8217;ve been reading this story over the course of, what, ten years now?</p>

I suddenly realized the distinction he was making and that he was speaking to me directly. So I closed the book and placed it on my shelf.</p>
<p>When Stephen King dies I will read the coda, making that day a little more or less sad.</p>
