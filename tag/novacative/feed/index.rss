				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;m putting this profile out there as a kind of beacon for the person who is looking for me. A single white stone forming a path leading to me.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I will continue as though you are that one person.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Hello, (your name goes here). I am overjoyed to finally meet you. I have been searching for you for years. I&#8217;ve seen you flickering in the corner of my eye, in dreams, in smiles, always ephemeral and fleeting. But now, here you are. You are beautiful and extraordinary.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I want to know everything that happened to you up until this moment. I want you to tell me what you&#8217;ve figured out about life. All the mistakes and triumphs. I will tell you my story as well. This will all take some time, so I figure we can spread it out across many conversations over coffee, in the car, at dinner, in bed, on airplanes, in sofa forts, after movies, during arguments, and even during our silences.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">We both came all this way. There will always be distances to cross, but I&#8217;m committed to cross them with you.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Let&#8217;s not date. Let&#8217;s not &#8220;be friends first and see where things go.&#8221;¬ù What if we talk about what we truly want out of a partner and then work to make that happen? Let&#8217;s have an adventure! Let us be extraordinary lovers and constant friends. Why not?</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I won&#8217;t give you any disclaimers and I expect none in return. It is true, things happened to us in the past, threads that wove us into what we are now. I want to know you, but I never want to understand you. I never want to figure you out, if that is even possible. I want to create a relationship where we are constantly exploring who we are to each other.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I&#8217;ve been looking all over for you, but now I need to stay still in one place and wait for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Please don&#8217;t be too long.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Find me.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well done. You&#8217;re almost there.</p>
<p>I am writing this message from the past, beginning at the end. At this moment, it is an anachronism, but it will slowly slip backward in time. Though many may read it, I write it only for you. It is the final beacon.</p>
<p>Thank you for your persistence. If things have gone according to plan, you will have enjoyed yourself. Though many may have played the game (or thought they were playing), only one person could ever win. And that&#8217;s you. I created all of this for you, my dear.</p>
<p>By now you know what the prize is and you must truly want it. Are you ready?</p>
<p>If you are, contact me and ask The Question.</p>
<p>This end is the beginning of everything.</p>
