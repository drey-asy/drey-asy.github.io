				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Allow me to direct your attention to some cool projects my friends have produced.</p>
<p>Ryan&#8217;s company is behind the technology used in <a href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/onesearch/voice;_ylt=AlJYDwPosUhXr_jka.nyDPbTtQcJ">Yahoo! oneSearch with Voice</a>. It lets you do searches on your phone by speaking instead of having to type everything. It will eventually be available for the iPhone.</p>
<p>Dave was on the team that created Steven Spielberg&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/wii/puzzle/pqrs/index.html?tag=result;title;0">Boom Blox</a>, what looks like an insanely fun game for the Wii. It was <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2008/5/5/">featured on Penny Arcade</a>, which, some might say, is the highest honor one can achieve in the video game world.</p>
<p>In the cardboard realm, a <a href="http://www.alderac.com/">game publisher</a> finally came to their senses and snatched up Dan&#8217;s Monkey Lab, a ridiculously fun board game. It will premiere at Essen, but there is no word on a release date. Trust me, you&#8217;re going to want to play this.</p>
<p>Speaking of board games, Marc&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gizmet.com/games/coalescence.html">Coalescence</a> is now available. It looks really sharp, is easy to learn and provides a lot of challenging fun.</p>
<p>And, finally, I heard that fellow Landmark graduate Jonna will be appearing in Oliver Stone&#8217;s film &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1175491/">W</a>&#8220;, filming now.</p>
<p>Congratulations, everyone, on bringing the awesome!</p>
