				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe writing from my iPad will magically inspire me to write. While sitting here watching words appear on this glowing obsidian slab is a delight, it is still a wonder which I have anticipated. The tools are a convenience, not story engines. When I dip into some new app or device, I feel like I&#8217;ve taken hold of a magic sword. Now anything is possible, I think. But the sword does not know how to sing without me.</p>
<p>Lately I have been devising strategies to trick myself into creating something. I come up with various exercises, low commitment stunt projects, fire and forget one offs. Nothing wrong with that, I guess.</p>
<p>But I still must return to the font, which now wheezes and gasps a faint mist (or is it now sand?). In my ponderings of what may have happened to my creative fire I have drawn a correlation to having become less crazy. The unspoken agreement has worked too well and the safe harbor from the storms of my mind has become a home. From this vantage point I observed much, my world held before me in a snow globe, regarded with clear eyes.</p>
<p>I have spent much of my life in fear of various measuring sticks. I always felt I was getting it wrong, that I was found wanting. This permeated all spheres of human interaction. But at the core was the feeling of failing at reality, of a diamond hard superstructure crushing what I felt was real. Now that I see that there is only a reality of consensus, a ridiculous web of dependent causality governing behavior, I wonder if there is anything left to fear.</p>
<p>I do not think it is healthy for me to be sane. It is a survival trait necessary for the muggle world, but I fear it may be a cancer of the spirit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a flash fiction piece I wrote this morning and serialized on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Ever the precocious child, Anton used the teleporter in many ways other than its intended purpose.</p>
<p>Cleaning his room, for example, was a trivial task now that he had a save state for it.</p>
<p>Anton’s meticulously arranged ZOMG!icons vs. Blazaroids diorama could swiftly return to its pristine state after each invasion.</p>
<p>And, with the Doppler circuit he created, Anton no longer had just one Amazium-plated AnnihiLord shock trooper. He had twenty-seven.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven <em>incrementally fragile</em> Amazium-plated AnnihiLord shock troopers, but nevertheless many more than Paige McAllister, who had only three.</p>
<p>Saturday mornings weren’t as fun without his brother Dmitri.</p>
<p>Anton rode the train into the city every afternoon. He inserted the same token each time. Only plebs and precocious children still used the trains.</p>
<p>He sat next to Dmitri’s hospital bed and read his twin the latest manga. He held up the slate so Dmitri could see the explosions.</p>
<p>The hospital staff had seen his father’s movies. They never troubled Anton with questions. They assured him Dmitri would wake up one day.</p>
<p>It would be a few days before they noticed that Anton’s parents had stopped visiting.</p>
<p>His mothers were always in the lab and his father filled the weekends with chute-less skydiving and BASE jumping.</p>
<p>Anton wished they stayed home more often.</p>
<p>Although a bright child for his age, he often lacked common sense, particularly when it came to mass conservation vs. lossy molecular compression algorithms.</p>
<p>The nurse saw Anton showing Dmitri his three new Blazaroid pilot action figures. “How lifelike they are,” she remarked.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for Anton’s parents, nothing was further from the truth.</p>
<p>The End.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the advent of cheap, ubiquitous public teleportation, casual inebriation has reached an all time high. When there&#8217;s a perfectly preserved saved state of yourself waiting back at the home terminal, there is no such thing as heroin addiction. In the clubs, amputation is already yawn-inducing performance art. Only your grandmother knows anyone who has seen an abortion clinic, let alone visited one. Tokyo is only as far away as Starbucks.</p>
<p>But you still arrive two hours late to all of my parties.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Poisoned!&#8221; cried Lord Sauding, hurling the  bowl away. It arced through the room before getting caught in the  sagging badminton net and sloshing its contents in orange glops. The  net relaxed and the crockery shattered into jagged bits as it hit the  floor.<span id="more-668"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not  poisoned, Lord, I assure you,&#8221; said Maybrick, sad eyes watching the  circular bits of pasta slide in the pooling soup. The Lord&#8217;s aide  towered over the strange throne, at least as tall as the Caretakers.  &#8220;You must remember I taste all your food and drink beforehand. The soup  was savory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do  not patronize me, you faggotty fuck!&#8221; Lord Sauding pressed the  thumbstick to spin the throne around to face Maybrick. The gears  whirred like arguing metal cats and oily smoke coughed from somewhere  inside the chassis. Maybrick looked down his slender nose at the  furious creature embedded in the wheeled chair. Maybrick waited  patiently as his master blinked and sputtered, his mind stooping to  collect the scattered leaves of his thought. The Bell&#8217;s Palsy had taken  residence in the left side of Lord Sauding&#8217;s jowly face, the corner of  his mouth permanently relaxed. Whenever he spoke, the image of a toad  caught on a hook resurfaced in Maybrick&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my Lord?&#8221; Maybrick asked, an eyebrow arched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iâ€¦I  want to see Feign,&#8221; Lord Sauding said, his bluster gone. His milky blue  eyes brimmed with tears. &#8220;I want to play with more keys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I  shall send for him immediately,&#8221; said Maybrick with a gentle nod,  causing a cascade of obsidian hair across his high forehead. He looked  again at the pool of soup. <em>Odorless, tastelessâ€¦a month&#8217;s wages wasted!</em> Maybrick  nodded to a spindly black figure hanging on the wall. Oubliette lifted  herself off the coat hook and scuttled out of the room.</p>
<p>Lord  Sauding rubbed his hands, satisfied. He turned a knob on the armrest  and sent the throne trundling forward. He liked to orbit the badminton  court as he made his kingly pronouncements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; asked Lord Sauding, &#8220;what is the next order of business?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Boatswain, have you seen my Felix? He was just here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bastian&#8217;s  hand found some wooden protrusion and steadied himself, and he spat an  oily wad of phlegm onto the deck. But he didn&#8217;t retch this time. He  felt his atrophied skills most profoundly in his limbs, heavy and  distant, like a stranger&#8217;s. Braced by the brittle sea air, he soon had  command of his senses once more. A gull shrieked above him, its wings  frozen by memory. Bastian wondered how long it would hang there. <em>Until there is no one left to remember. Or longer.</em></p>
<p>He turned to face her.<span id="more-667"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not the boatswain,&#8221; said Patrice. She twirled a pink parasol over her shoulder as she studied him.  Her  dress was all layers and lace, a garment unfit for adventures in lonely  halls. Bastian&#8217;s eyes latched on the satchel dangling at her waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re  here to trade,&#8221; she said, understanding the look. He nodded, &#8220;Yes,  that&#8217;s right.&#8221; It was Patrice, but a Patrice that did not know him. <em>Best to get down to it. </em></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ve  you got?&#8221; she asked, propping the parasol against a tarp-covered crate.  Her hair was shorter than he remembered. Bastian walked across the  deck, planks creaking underfoot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Words, mostly. Good ones, though. I&#8217;ve got &#8216;<em>lame de fond</em>.&#8217; It&#8217;s French forâ€¦&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Groundswell. Yes, I know,&#8221; Patrice snapped. &#8220;Look where you are. We&#8217;re lousy with seaman&#8217;s tongues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,  of course,&#8221; Bastian rubbed the back of his neck. &#8220;Stupid.&#8221; He looked  out at the ocean. It stretched into forever, turning into a grayish  smear on the horizon. A word bloomed and he rapped the crate with his  knuckles. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got one for a Japanese flower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes went wide and nearly snapped his heart in two. &#8220;Give it, then!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see yours first!&#8221; Bastian tapped the top of the crate, falling back into the groove of his business.</p>
<p>Instead  of opening the satchel, Patrice revealed a locket shining at her neck.  Bastian felt the cold at the core of the sea flood up into his legs. &#8220;I  have this. Isn&#8217;t it lovely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bastian, too loudly. Patrice took a step back, concern in her brow. &#8220;Noâ€¦we deal in keys.&#8221; <em>And if you traded that to me I&#8217;d never see Patrice again.</em></p>
<p>She  nodded and pulled a ring laden with keys from her satchel. They tinkled  and clanked as she fanned them over the tarp. &#8220;Here&#8217;s one that has  &#8216;343&#8217; on it. I&#8217;ve got a &#8216;660&#8217; as wellâ€¦&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worthless. No numbers. I want shapes, sigils.&#8221;  One of his many bitter lessons was that the numbers on the doors were lies.</p>
<p>&#8220;What  about this one? It looks like a bat.&#8221; He could see he had offended her.  She wouldn&#8217;t look directly at him, finding bits of lint to pick out of  her dress. Bastian wanted to apologize, to explain. Instead he nodded,  scooping up her offering. It did indeed look like a bat. Patrice  blinked, relieved.</p>
<p>Bastian turned to leave and then remembered. &#8220;<em>Sakurasou</em>. It means &#8216;longing&#8217;.&#8221; <em>Or &#8216;home&#8217;.</em> Patrice smiled quietly, eyes drawn inward to study this new acquisition.</p>
<p>He knew Oubliette would be impatient by now and, his business concluded, he ought to return.</p>
<p>But something suddenly occurred to Bastian.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m archiving some of my entries from a now defunct collaborative writing project, the entirety of which can be found here: <a href="http://collectiveinventioncontention.blogspot.com/">http://collectiveinventioncontention.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Bondmistress Oubliette herself had come to find him. The sputtering bulb in the elevator shone through the wide moth eaten brim of her hat, dappling her pale face with sodium-colored light. Of all the caretakers, Bastian considered Oubliette&#8217;s face the most well maintained.<span id="more-664"></span></p>
<p>Her arm unfolded like a graceful black umbrella, gesturing for him to join her. Wanting to give no cause for suspicion, he immediately stepped into the cab, a space immediately cramped by the bustle of her dress.</p>
<p>Oubliette turned her gaze down upon him, smooth white eyes set in a smooth white face interrupted only by a thin crevice. He heard her scratch and click just under its surface, but the hinges did not move. For a moment Bastian felt the words rise from their hidden place, burning up through his forehead where she could surely read them.</p>
<p>He gulped relief as she looked away, but held his breath as her eyes fell now on the sheet hung on the opposite wall. &#8220;See nothing,&#8221; he thought at her, as though it might help. &#8220;They&#8217;re just scribbles.&#8221; The Bondmistress did not move. &#8220;Her face will open now,&#8221; Bastian thought, certain that the scratching in her head had grown agitated.</p>
<p>But then the doors closed and Oubliette&#8217;s arms moved absently about, sending the elevator back up.</p>
<p>Pull, spin, step.</p>
