				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Doughty and his crew get on stage half an hour early, disguised as a noise jam band. They wear beards and funny hats, but the crowd is not fooled.</p>
<p>The Panderers pander and we accept.</p>
<p>Mr. Doughty returns. His voice is indeed golden and delicious. New tracks and Soul Coughing throwbacks. The crowd enjoys.</p>
<p>Mr. Doughty denounces the use of pot. It being 4/20, the audience misunderstands, screaming with joy.</p>
<p>Circles!</p>
<p>Mr. Doughty explains that he is going to throw the bridge out and replace it with &#8220;half-mumbled half-words&#8221;. The crowd accepts this proposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Doughty plays the best cover of Kenny Rogers&#8217; The Gambler ever performed.</p>
<p>Mr. Doughty plays a fake last song, asks us to pretend he has left the stage when he in fact is just turning to face the back of the stage, turns back around to play the real last song.</p>
<p>Crowd spills out of Antone&#8217;s.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, a conversation came up about our favorite bands. As usual, I didn&#8217;t have a list of favorite musicians floating within easy grasp. I like lots of music. In fact, I&#8217;m not sure there is a kind of music I <em>dis</em>like.</p>
<p>So, my obsessiveness kicked in and I decided to figure out who my favorite bands and singers were by sifting through my music collection and counting up the number of songs I really enjoyed by each artist. I briefly considered working out some kind of signal to noise ratio, taking into consideration the volume of work, but that sounded too complicated. So I went for the sheer number of awesome songs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with:</p>
<p>1.	U2<br />
2.	Weird Al Yankovic<br />
3.	Steve Taylor<br />
4.	Toad the Wet Sprocket<br />
5.	Pink Floyd<br />
6.	INXS<br />
7.	They Might Be Giants<br />
8.	The Beatles<br />
9.	The Police<br />
10.	Indigo Girls<br />
11.	Billy Joel<br />
12.	R.E.M.<br />
13.	Sting<br />
14.	Nine Inch Nails<br />
15.	Moxy Fruvous<br />
16.	Syd&#8217;s Misconception<br />
17.	Pearl Jam<br />
18.	Soul Coughing<br />
19.	Bon Jovi<br />
20.	Jars of Clay</p>
<p>So there it is. I think this list comprises types of music that resonate with every aspect of my personality. I see passion, social change, sarcasm, unconventional spirituality, introspection, melancholy, regret, vast inner landscapes, fun, sex, nostalgia, innocence, poetry, feminine energy, anger, depression, friendship, longing, eclecticism, attitude, and humility.</p>

We were walking through the main hall outside the auditoriums and I saw Jonathan Coulton standing there with his guitar. We walked past and then I thought &#8220;No, wait, I can&#8217;t just keep walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I backtracked and said hi, asking if he was doing any gigs during the festival. He said he had done a non-SXSW show last night (curses!) and then he was playing at some party tonight. I didn&#8217;t have a pass, so I wouldn&#8217;t be able to get in. But it was cool to meet him and chat briefly and burst out in uncontrolled fanboy gushing. I did that later. In private.</p>

I hung out with some folks at the Ginger Man, a charming establishment with a long wall of brews. I tried the Bigfoot Ale, which I detested at first, but then grew to, well&#8230; endure.</p>
<p>Then I headed over to the next block to Fado, where I heard a U2 cover band was playing. For all intents and purposes, their lead singer <em>was </em>Bono. He looked just like him. He even had all the stage moves, engaging us in wild, rock star antics. They played mostly B-sides, but threw in some of the hits. They were very good.</p>
<p>All the while I was painfully aware of this sea of attractive women, all on someone&#8217;s arm or wearing a ring. I always wonder where they were before. When does that window of opportunity occur?</p>
<p>And then there was the waitress. She resembled Juliette from Lost, who, as some may know, is a representative of archetypal hotness  for me. The whole night, she had to squeeze past me on her way to and from the bar. It almost made me cry.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted so badly<br />
somebody other than me<br />
Staring back at me<br />
but you were gone</p>
<p>I wanted to see you walking backwards<br />
And get the sensation of you coming home<br />
<strong> I wanted to see you walking away from me<br />
Without the sensation of you leaving me alone</strong></p>
<p>Time and time again<br />
Time and time again<br />
Time and time again<br />
I can&#8217;t please myself</p>
<p>I wanted the ocean to cover over me<br />
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet<br />
<strong> Maybe someday I won&#8217;t be so lonely<br />
And I&#8217;ll walk on water every chance I get</strong></p>
<p>Time and time again<br />
Time and time again<br />
Time and time again<br />
I can&#8217;t please myself</p>
<p>So when are you coming home, sweet angel?<br />
You leaving me alone? all alone?<br />
<strong> Well if I&#8217;m drowning, darling, you&#8217;ll come down this way on your own</strong></p>
<p><strong>I wish I was traveling on a freeway<br />
Beneath this graveyard western sky<br />
I&#8217;m gonna set fire to this city<br />
And out into the desert we&#8217;re gonna ride</strong></p>
<p>Time and time again<br />
Time and time again<br />
Time and time again<br />
I can&#8217;t please myself</p>
<p><strong>I can&#8217;t please myself<br />
I can&#8217;t please nobody else</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Counting Crows</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine shared this song with me today and it just destroyed me. It resonates on so many levels. It seems impossible that someone wrote it without knowing me. I know the people in the song. I&#8217;ve been looking for her.</p>
<p>The Girl That&#8217;s Never Been<br />
&#8211; Escape Key</p>
<p>It was sixteen years ago, outside an aging movie show<br />
I was found not knowing where I was that night<br />
Not a thing did I possess but an old blue gingham dress<br />
And a faded photograph in black and white<br />
Now my memories are quite clear, even if I still can hear<br />
All the shrinks who said some trauma was to blame<br />
Light another cigarette, breathe in deep, try to forget<br />
That it&#8217;s a photograph of Dinah and that Alice is my name</p>
<p>Chorus:<br />
Save me, save me, I&#8217;ve lost my memory<br />
I&#8217;m outside the world looking in<br />
Save me, save me, I&#8217;m lost in the memory<br />
And I&#8217;d swear I&#8217;m a girl that&#8217;s never been</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s all the life I knew, except I know it can&#8217;t be true<br />
I&#8217;m not her&#8211; there&#8217;s no such thing as Wonderland<br />
Hold a steady job somehow, three months clean and sober now<br />
Oh, the ways I tried to get back there again<br />
&#8220;Try to move on, don&#8217;t be sad&#8211;&#8221; so I placed a personal ad<br />
I asked, why is a raven like a writing desk?<br />
And on the phone, out of the past, so glad he&#8217;s found me now at last&#8211;<br />
And I&#8217;m afraid to go and meet him but I know my answer&#8217;s yes</p>
<p>[chorus]</p>
<p>Just another city loner wearing sunglasses at night<br />
Leather jacket, purple turtleneck and blue jeans worn too tight<br />
Just a rummie by the jukebox in a casual curious pose<br />
But I don&#8217;t know how he knows the things he knows</p>
<p>Well he sits down with a grin, &#8220;Why little Alice, where&#8217;ve you been?<br />
Not so little, not so Alice, now, are you?&#8221;<br />
As he sips my untouched drink, I say &#8220;I can&#8217;t be who I think&#8221;<br />
He says &#8220;You are, and you&#8217;re not, and I am too.<br />
Are we figments of our gin?  Are we long-lost orphaned kin?<br />
Or the mad descendants of a writer&#8217;s pen?<br />
No one&#8217;s sane behind their mask.  Ask what you really want to ask.&#8221;<br />
And I close my eyes and whisper, &#8220;Can you take me back again?&#8221;</p>
<p>[chorus]</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling Alice, so bereft, there&#8217;s no back&#8211; you never left.<br />
All the rhymes are still there waiting to be sung.&#8221;<br />
And he holds up in the air a little picture paper square<br />
Slips between my lips and underneath my tongue.<br />
&#8220;Shall I tell you now, Miss Little, what&#8217;s the answer to the riddle<br />
Of the raven that you used to send your call?&#8221;<br />
He takes the glasses off to see, yellow cat&#8217;s eyes turn on me, and says,<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing like a writing desk at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chorus:<br />
Save me, save me, I&#8217;ve lost my memory<br />
I&#8217;m outside the world looking in<br />
Save me, save me, I&#8217;m lost in the memory<br />
And I&#8217;d swear I&#8217;m a girl that&#8217;s never been<br />
And he faded, leaving nothing but a grin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The woman next to me at the concert said that JD completely blows Michael Hutchence away.  She explained that Michael was already in decline so it made sense for him to kill himself and now he&#8217;s in hell looking up at JD wishing he were still alive.  Somehow I avoided decapitating this woman and said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;  She bought me a beer, so that helped.  I hadn&#8217;t watched Rockstar INXS because I thought it was obscene and I had only heard the new album once.  But I wanted to see INXS in concert and, until Rhythm &#8216;n Hues can bring back a virtual Michael, this was as good as it was going to get.</p>
<p>And she was wrong.  JD is a fantastic performer, but is devoid of passion, sensuality and authenticity.  He looked like he was having a great time pretending to be the lead singer of INXS.  The band sounded great, but the disparity between JD and Michael cast them in an INXS tribute band light.  Where the Beck concert was authentic and fun, this one seemed manufactured and cold.  Needless to say, I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic trying to leave the ampitheater.</p>
