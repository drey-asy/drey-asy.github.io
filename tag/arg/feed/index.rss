				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well done. You&#8217;re almost there.</p>
<p>I am writing this message from the past, beginning at the end. At this moment, it is an anachronism, but it will slowly slip backward in time. Though many may read it, I write it only for you. It is the final beacon.</p>
<p>Thank you for your persistence. If things have gone according to plan, you will have enjoyed yourself. Though many may have played the game (or thought they were playing), only one person could ever win. And that&#8217;s you. I created all of this for you, my dear.</p>
<p>By now you know what the prize is and you must truly want it. Are you ready?</p>
<p>If you are, contact me and ask The Question.</p>
<p>This end is the beginning of everything.</p>
