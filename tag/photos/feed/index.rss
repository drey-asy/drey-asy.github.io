				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2036" style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px" src="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2010/01/MasterMao.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="204" />Master Mao, all around cool cat,  is recovering from whatever adventure led to his fractured foot. The vet told me to keep him inside for a week and then bring him back for an exam. True to his chill nature, Master Mao hasn&#8217;t let a splint and a cast get in his way. I even had to chase him down when one of the maintenance guys left the door open and Mao went tearing off. He likes hanging out here, but he&#8217;s used to being an outdoor cat.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s become even more affectionate and clingy after coming back from the vet. Maybe he understands that I helped him out. While he&#8217;s technically a stray and no one can be said to <em>own </em>Master Mao, he&#8217;s certainly become important to me over the last year. Seeing him with his leg all twisted broke my heart. I couldn&#8217;t *not* help him. The vet kept the cost down to $200 and even gave me a payment plan option. Not a big deal. I mean, we&#8217;re talking about <em>Master Mao</em> here.</p>

I joined an amateur photography meetup and went to my first meetup with them today. It was a blustery day at the state capitol building and about twenty-five of us gathered on the steps.</p>
<p>The guy in charge really knew what he was talking about and gave us all useful advice about basic digital camera settings. Even though this was an amateur photographer meetup, I noticed that most everyone was packing some serious hardware. I felt lens envy. Theirs were all longer than mine.</p>
<p>The instruction went on for several hours and it was really cold, so I ended up not sticking around to actually practice what I had just learned, other than a few random shots I got off. Even those looked a lot better in terms of exposure and picture quality than the sorts of photos I&#8217;ve taken in the past.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my skills at Photoshop make me look like a slightly better photographer than I actually am.</p>

<p>Drat. Where will we have the dinner party now?</p>
<p><img width="400" height="300" src="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/Chairs.jpg" /></p>
<p>My car was buried under an impenetrable layer of snow.</p>
<p><img width="400" height="300" src="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/Snow-car.jpg" /></p>
<p>The camper out back fared no better.</p>
<p><img width="400" height="300" src="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/Snow1.jpg" /></p>
<p>The streets were transformed.</p>
<p><img width="400" height="300" src="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/Snow2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Recent excavations in my back yard unearthed some sort of frozen beast!</p>
<p><img width="400" height="263" src="http://www.andremonserrat.com/files/2011/03/Snow-Dragon1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Note its baleful stare.</p>
