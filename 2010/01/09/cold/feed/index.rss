		<description><![CDATA[I lived in both Arizona and North Carolina for a while, God knows how I ended up back in Ohio.  I feel the cold more now than ever before, but I have virtually no memory of it being cold when I was younger.  It seemed I could stay outside for an entire day and suffer no ill effect.

I vividly remeber hiking through the woods to the hills behind Brookledge GC, clinging to the plastic sleds while flying down the main hill there, and hiking back up the cross country ski trails to the fire that seemed to perpetually burn at the top of the hill.

Despite feeling the cold more, I still enjoy hiking in the snow.  The past few weeks have afforded me an excellent opportunity.  Unfortunatley those old hills are no more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was in Indiana over the Christmas holiday, I think the quality of cold there is different from the cold here. here, it&#039;s an invader and it knows it, so it tries real hard to get in wherever it can...it&#039;s a pushy kind of cold. In Indiana, it was a very still cold that stayed where it was put and didn&#039;t try to get into my personal space :)]]></description>
