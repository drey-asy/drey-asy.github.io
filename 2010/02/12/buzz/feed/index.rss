		<description><![CDATA[Foursquare definitely looks interesting and I want to check it out. What usually happens to me with apps like that is I end up being the only person in my circle of friends who uses it. I think the apps which emphasize the social aspect of social media are more fun when there&#039;s a broad buy-in from one&#039;s own social circle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m often among the first to leap aboard interesting new social networking ideas. I&#039;m particularly fond of things like Gowalla and Foursquare, which encourage you to go out and &quot;do&quot; things, you know, outdoors.

Buzz, though? I&#039;ll confess I haven&#039;t given it a go myself yet - but I don&#039;t really see the point. My main online &quot;socialising&quot; is done through Twitter mostly, Facebook second (though that site gets more and more irritating daily) and that&#039;s about it.

The trouble with starting a new social networking gizmo is that people who are already established on something like Twitter are going to be hesitant to jump ship to something else. This means you get distinct communities forming on different sites.

This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. It helps to filter the noise a bit. Plurk, for example, which is like Twitter with comment threads, is mostly populated by Japanese people and Second Life enthusiasts. Bebo is full of chavs/gang members - at least here in the UK. MySpace has its own &quot;subculture&quot;, as does Facebook, though Facebook is probably what could be considered an online &quot;pop culture&quot; rather than a distinct community of its own.

In some ways I like the ability to say things and for other people to hear them. In &quot;reality&quot;, I often feel stifled or nervous. However, as with anything, you can have too much of a good thing, I think. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hear hear. I tend to adopt social networks based on the people who used them who I want to stay connected with. I have most of my stuff integrated through a feed reader. I don&#039;t use Facebook that much b/c it doesn&#039;t integrate like that well. Buzz doesn&#039;t seem like it adds much to the space except confusion.]]></description>
