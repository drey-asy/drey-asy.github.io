		<description><![CDATA[Your experience might be different with the card printing side of the business. Marc&#039;s initial run of Rocket Yard looked pretty good, though he mentioned they messed up his latest batch. Also, I had a look at Misery Bubblegum, another card game they printed and it looked pretty good.

Maybe just avoid using red in the graphics. I hear they have some trouble with that color.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow.  That&#039;s really, really disappointing.  Jeremy and I were seriously considering using Guild of Blades for the FATE card decks for our upcoming release of Inevitable, but this story really doesn&#039;t inspire confidence.

I may give them one test run with a ten-deck order - just to see - but I&#039;m inclined to take my business elsewhere simply as a gesture of solidarity.

Thanks for sharing your experience, Andre.  I&#039;m sorry that it happened to you.]]></description>
