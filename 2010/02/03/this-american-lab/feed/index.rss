		<description><![CDATA[I listen to TAL every week, and have the podcast on my iPod, so I can listen again.. :)  RadioLab is new to me, but I really like it too.. it&#039;s a little more.. something.

I always love finding that perfect song for the situation...]]></description>

I&#039;ve checked out the podcasts since then but, unfortunately, I seem to have a hard time listening to radio outside of a car setting.]]></description>
