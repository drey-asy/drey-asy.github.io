		<description><![CDATA[Though I haven&#039;t given it anywhere near this kind of thought, I agree with you. Another type of game is the type that has attempted to map a myriad of player choices into separate and distinct narratives. This, when well done, has phenomenal replay value; you need to go back and reply time after time to find out what happens when you make different choices.

This seems like such a good idea, and yet I often find myself shying away from such games. Once I have felt the tension of the narrative and lived through its resolution, I don&#039;t necessarily WANT to experience it again. I want to move on. I want to find a new narrative. I&#039;m not a big re-reader of books either :-p.

Therefore, I tend to lean toward games that either have very shallow narratives and infinite freedom or games that are completely linear. I can play Oblivion until I get tired of it, and I don&#039;t have to feel as if I missed anything of importance in the narrative, even if I only explored a small fraction of my choices. OTOH, in a game like the Final Fantasy series, I&#039;m perfectly fine with viewing it as a series of puzzles or quests rewarded by the next installment of a compelling story. What I don&#039;t want to face is the regret of my choices when I don&#039;t have the attention span to go play over again.]]></description>
