		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for reading it, Jeff! Yes, those were characters from PAWNS. I like to have cross-overs in my stories. The hot dog vendor in Frayed was based on Manuel. I wrote that scene before I started Frayed and wanted to work that character into a story somehow. 

enCompass is an amalgam of trends I&#039;ve seen in social media games as well as some ideas I have had for iPhone apps. It is part Gowalla, part Epic Win, part augmented reality, plus lots of other parts thrown in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting the story -- I enjoyed it.  Made me laugh out loud at certain times (the office and Krav Maga scenes).  A number of the other scenes brought up some unsettling concepts and imagery.    

Did I notice a few cameos from our PAWNS game?  The Technomancer, Golem, and the Queen?  Manuel reminded me of the hot dog vendor in Frayed.  Wish I could find a wise vendor somewhere who could get my life straightened out....

I think I read about a real-life game that was like enCompass.  Can&#039;t remember what it was called, though.]]></description>
