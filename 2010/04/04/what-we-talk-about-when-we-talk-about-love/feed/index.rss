		<description><![CDATA[I have been working on my zen studies to be less &quot;fraught&quot; and more connected to all that is to feel that oneness.  But the connecting with another person is a need, touching more than just a desire, but something that I go atrophied without (and the part of me that doesn&#039;t want to be weak doesn&#039;t want this to be true).  
The other possibility is that you are connected and can&#039;t feel it.  But this has nothing to do with the day to day companionship and sharing of your life that it seems like you&#039;re talking about.

:)  Course, all of me is full of it, probably. I just started doing the OKCupid thing myself.  It&#039;s a difficult thing to express to others exactly what it is you need...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I try to be strong &#038; independent. But sometimes that realization of my need for a kindred spirit is overwhelming, most especially @ times like those you describe--wanting to share those experiences.  Then other times when that feeling of estrangement falls heavy, I&#039;m filled with peace, reminded by an Over the Rhine lyric: &quot;I&#039;m lonely but never alone.&quot;  Adam enjoyed meeting God in the garden, but God still created Eve so Adam wouldn&#039;t be alone.  And so I remain cautiously optimistic...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard just about every kind of advice on this topic. I feel like it is something so subjective, that only the broadest, common sense advice applies.

There is no universal method. Otherwise this wouldn&#039;t be an issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post really moved me. It&#039;s so true. I know this feeling very well, even though I eventually rolled a critical success in the companionship department. This sense of being alone in a group, of leaving the table hungry even when surrounded by friends, rings True.

Not to diss the previous commenter, but I don&#039;t really go for giving &quot;finding love&quot; advice. And if I were giving it, I couldn&#039;t think of anything to suggest that you&#039;re not already doing. I think finding intimacy is just a game of chance, and I am shocked sometimes at the people who get there fast vs. the people who struggle for so long without.

I think the additional self-awareness is a benefit in itself. Perhaps it will influence the Fates in ways we can&#039;t see.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are over 6.5 billion souls on this planet. Each one of us has special buttons that turn us on or off. In order to make a connection with someone, you must think out of the box. That&#039;s your box. If you think of yoursef and your needs, no matter how noble and tender they might be, you will receive only an echo of yourself. A connection can only be established when we listen and respond with empathy rather than when we broadcast our feelings.

Life is not about what we want from it. But, about what we will do to get it. And the opposite sex must be convinced that you are serious about it. They call this SECURITY.]]></description>
