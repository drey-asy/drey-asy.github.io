		<description><![CDATA[what is the intended orientation of the room cards? i know they are placed on the table and you look down to see the room. but is the room card a representation of the whole 3d room, or the walls or the floors? is the grid on each card a window or a glass-like plane? is it an imaginative maze orientation similar to the one in the movie &quot;labyrinth&quot; or the movie &quot;the cube&quot;? are you walking IN to a room or falling down into a room or just observing a room looking through a window?]]></description>
