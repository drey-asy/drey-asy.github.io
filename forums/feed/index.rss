		<description><![CDATA[The back of the box mentions some kind of downloadable content or expansion, so that should be somewhere on this site, right? But where? Also, there seems to be no reference to the &#039;Whack Room&#039; room card in the rules I assumed this was to be mentioned on the website? There&#039;s a Whack card too that tells you to look it up online. How?]]></description>
