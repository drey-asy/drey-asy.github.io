		<description><![CDATA[Getting in late on the discussion.

I was meditating the other day in my interior world, and I had posed a question to some of the people there, and they told me &quot;nobody knows nothing.&quot;  It was in regard to what I should feel/do about something that was going on in my life.  But they were all hanging out, like bedouins in the desert, and waiting for things to happen, to see what was going to come about.

This is probably confusing as to why I would share this in relation to this question.  I don&#039;t think certainty enters into any of this.  In fact, I think that it&#039;s not something that can&#039;t be part of the discussion related to the divine.  That&#039;s an element of faith, which is in essence and by needs subjective.  

What you can know and be certain of is the love you feel between and for people and things, of the company you keep while you wait for signs and for things to happen, or the things you create and make happen which bring you joy.  

I&#039;m trying to reconcile the complexity which is human emotion and mind with the strictures that religion places on us.  Should I feel badly about coveting another man&#039;s wife?  Because if I do, it&#039;s really hard to tell me not to do it.  How do I handle that?  I think the Bible is reflective of that complication, as the commandments say you shouldn&#039;t do that, and yet King David kinda had a problem with that and it turned out ok...

So I guess what I&#039;m saying is that while I may look to the major religious texts to see how other people have handled this mass of confusion that is being human, I&#039;m probably not going to take any of them as THE RULES for this thing called life that I have been blessed with (and yes, I feel blessed:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By the way, I&#039;m going back to your original post, and I find a lot of beauty in it.  I think I agree with what you say here more than I realized at first reading.  I actually think that all religious perspectives CAN be likened to using a slide rule to measure love.  But I would counter that you need not feel dread.  I think we need to release ourselves from the need to own Truth and embrace the quest for it.  Like so many parts of living, you can never get there; you can only hope to get close enough to see how far you have to go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what I actually believe. What I&#039;d like to believe is this: God is bigger than any human understanding. But at the same time, we are God, each of us is a face of the Divine. God is Love and we are God when we love one another and behave in a compassionate, thoughtful way toward all other parts of creation. I would like to believe that when we die, we are shed of our body&#039;s limitations of understanding and loving, and that we finally understand and love in a fully God-Like way. That&#039;s what I&#039;d like to believe. But most people are such complete bastards I just really can&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What would we do now if we knew all that we wanted to know? Tweek God&#039;s decisions?  Offer Him advice? Analyze His plans?

I think that in Heaven we WILL &quot;know as we are known&quot; and have fully all the potential we could possibly have.  Not just have but be able to excercise those abilities with others who have fulfilled their own potentials.

That would be reason to praise God. 

Maybe it would be like going to the ALAMO and always finding everyone you want to talk/listen to be there. And they mutually glad that you came.]]></description>
