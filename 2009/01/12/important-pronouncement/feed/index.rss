		<description><![CDATA[I like being single. It&#039;s only during those &#039;tiny&#039; moments where I sometimes get lonely and wish &#039;I wish someone was here with me right now&#039;.

I&#039;ve been single for about 8 months now. . .the problem is the last girlfriend is pregnant and we are expecting our baby in 1 month. So I&#039;ve been a bit pre-occupied and wondering. . .when can I actually date again? 1 year after the baby? Five? whhhhhaaaaaa?

And then I am wondering only because I feel I have an obligation to bring a solid female presence into my home on a daily basis (instead of only 3.5 days a week) for the child.

I like being single. . .but once a baby is involved and your single. . .it opens up a whole new world.]]></description>
