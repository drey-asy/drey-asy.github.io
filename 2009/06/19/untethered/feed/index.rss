		<description><![CDATA[I also had a recent re-discovery of the library that was very similar to the one you described.  I was also impressed with the range of stuff available.  The only annoyance I&#039;ve really found is if there&#039;s a movie coming out based on a book and I try to reserve it.  There&#039;s usually a huge wait.

I&#039;m still having a difficult time switching to e-books.  I do read the occasional text book from Gutenburg Project, but most of my reading is with a physical book.  I enjoy the smell and texture of the pages, and I like how they don&#039;t need batteries/power. 

I&#039;m glad you are feeling lighter.  Last year, I threw out a bunch of stuff I&#039;ve been holding for years, and it did make me feel better. 

I like the new look of the site!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am concerned about multi-monitor support on a laptop. Right now I have three displays. I supposed I could get used to the laptop&#039;s display and one really wide display.

I do use the computer for video editing and graphic design, but I think laptops can handle it.

I&#039;m using the AirShare app and it works for my purposes. I can map it as a drive on my desktop and move documents to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I highly recommend the laptop route. It&#039;s not really that much more expensive, and unless you&#039;re doing crazy games or video production on your pc, you&#039;ll be fine. I haven&#039;t really had a desktop as a main machine in the last half dozen years, and it&#039;s been awesome.

Also, clouding all your mail and data and whatnot is a great move. Of course, if Google ever bites it, we&#039;re screwed, but yeah.

Which iPhone app are you using for the wireless storage thing? I&#039;ve played with Air Sharing a bit, but found it kind of clunky.]]></description>
