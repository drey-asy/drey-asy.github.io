In defense of the meme, I  think maybe memes are just very big in-jokes for a very big group of friends. Finding instant commonalities and reasons to laugh together with people we&#039;ve just met can&#039;t be all bad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not saying that *society* is a virus, but that memes are a social virus. I think memes are a by-product of internet culture, but they can no more uphold the culture itself  than the shadow of a table can uphold a turkey dinner. But that&#039;s the danger: We&#039;re leaning on memes as though they were sturdy.

Saying &quot;the cake is a lie&quot; is social currency, a kind of geek handshake. But that phrase can be used to do all kinds of heavy lifting. You&#039;re saying something clever, but you yourself are not clever. Suddenly you&#039;re thinking of ways of inserting the phrase into a conversation where you might have said something else, perhaps something original, something that was *you*.

While we&#039;re all &quot;thinking&quot; about &quot;the cake is a lie,&quot; what *aren&#039;t* we thinking about? How useful is it for hundreds of thousands of people to be simultaneously witty about the same idea?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is cliched to say that society is a virus, but that doesn&#039;t make it any less true. Memes are just human civilization in small, bite sized form, sort of like a jelly candy shaped like an apple. It looks the same, and you eat them both, but one is filling and has nutritional content, while the other isn&#039;t and doesn&#039;t. Aren&#039;t they, in a way, what a culture is based off? 

Just speculating here, thanks for something to think about.]]></description>
