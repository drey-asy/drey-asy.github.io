		<description><![CDATA[Hey Drey,

I love venting on blogs. It feels good. This guy seems like he is desperate for some dough is pursuing all possibilities. He can&#039;t possibly take it any further since there isn&#039;t any paper work dictating he was owed anything. Vent away but he won&#039;t get anything and he can&#039;t sue you or anything.

Oh, and while I&#039;m here. I promoted House of Whack on Secure Immaturity so I need some advertsing fees. Just saying. No big deal. . .just get back to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[if I had to guess, I&#039;d say this person was a classic example of &quot;narcissistic personality disorder&quot; but you probably get annoyed with armchair psychologists :)

bleh. I&#039;m sorry you had to deal with that. Some people have never done enough work in life to realize that there is a long, hard road between &#039;idea&#039; and &#039;end product&#039; and they think one is of the same value as the other.]]></description>
