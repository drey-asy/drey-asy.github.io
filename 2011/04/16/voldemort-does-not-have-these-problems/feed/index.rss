		<description><![CDATA[I know exactly what you mean about the nasal sprays!  By far, the most disgusting I&#039;ve ever used is Astelin.

I&#039;m glad you&#039;re getting some relief, but surgery probably is inevitable, if you want to not have issues.  For me, getting my allergies under control, and getting my wisdom teeth removed seemed to be the magic bullet for making me be less infected and gross in general.  It was a long road to that conclusion though.

My friend Katie has had the tonsil stones issues, and she just had hers removed last year.

good luck, my sniffy friend.]]></description>
