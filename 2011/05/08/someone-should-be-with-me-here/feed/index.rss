		<description><![CDATA[As a Landmark graduate, I&#039;m sure you still remember that life is all about choices and there is no point in projecting the past into the future. It&#039;s not what you have done in your nearly 39 years of life. But, what you want your life to be like tomorrow.

No one can change you but yourself. Thus, looking for someone to &quot;Change your life&quot; happens only in the movies. And, do not expect to change anyone. The trick is to find someone who will accept you as you are and for you to be open-minded as well. In physics, opposite bodies attract each other. The more differences between you and your partner, the more you need each other.

Many people do not &quot;Close the Sale&quot; because they never ask. You&#039;ll never know if someone &quot;Fits&quot; if you do not ask. It takes guts to overcome vulnerability. But, what do you have to lose? Another lonely night?]]></description>
