		<description><![CDATA[I loved that about Braid and Limbo. Sometimes I thought I had encountered a glitch in the game. The puzzle seemed so impossible. It was very rewarding to figure it out.

Mass Effect 2 had an emotional impact on me after the big final mission. I kept playing the game and whenever I had to select a party and I saw those empty slots where teammates used to be, I&#039;d mourn them and wonder if I could have saved them.

I haven&#039;t played Rameses or Kaged, but I will look them up and download them to  my iPad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually just finished Limbo a few minutes ago.  I played Braid several months ago.  I refrained from reading your review on Bastion since I haven&#039;t played it yet.     

What struck me most about these games was how I was able to overcome the seemingly impossible tasks set before me.  I remember thinking &quot;I&#039;ll never figure this out&quot; but then, soon enough, I&#039;d figure it out.  

Maybe this is uncool to say, but the Mass Effect games really packed an emotional punch for me.  For three days after I finished the first one (and again after the finishing the second one) I really couldn&#039;t do anything else but think about what happened.  

Have you delved much into the indie text adventure (or &quot;interactive fiction&quot;) scene?  There&#039;s some really experimental, cool, and powerful stuff out there.  I&#039;d recommend checking out &quot;Rameses: A Tale of Heroes&quot; by Stephen Bond and &quot;Kaged&quot; by Ian Finley.  I played through both of those years ago, and they still resonate with me.]]></description>
