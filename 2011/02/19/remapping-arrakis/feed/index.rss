		<description><![CDATA[Wow! Fantastic: 
You combine good artwork with structured clarity - so players easily see, what territories are save, where borders are and what type of territory they are in. Also the font is stunning!
Only thing I am missing are the spice-blow-markers - and of course the other important stuff, like player dots, placeholder for tanks/spicedeck etc...
...but as you have written: it is not the final version yet...]]></description>
