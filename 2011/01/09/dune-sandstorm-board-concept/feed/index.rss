		<description><![CDATA[Thoughts:
• You&#039;re right.  The physical representation of the storm in the original game is awfully tiny when compared to its impact on gameplay.
• Printing protected locations on the upper plastic layer is a brilliant idea.  That would add significantly to making the effects of the storm easier to understand.
• Rivets or other fasteners in the corners are an alternative to adhesive.  The advantage is that they will probably be more secure, and may be able to attache and detach if needed.  The disadvantage (which could be an advantage if you incorporate them into the graphic design) is that they&#039;re very visible.
• You&#039;re concerned about moving the storm great distances.  if you also cut out grippy space in the bottom board, and make the bottom board thicker, it&#039;ll be easier to grip the disc and move it.  That&#039;s an awful lot of extra work for little gain, though.]]></description>
